The bank, which is based in Britain but generates much of its earnings in Asia, said that Jackson Tai, the former vice chairman and chief executive of DBS, would join its board effective on Monday. Mr. Tai, who is 66 and known as Jack, is a former JPMorgan Chase investment banker who served as chairman for the Asia-Pacific region before joining DBS. “It is rare to find the combination of hands-on banking expertise, top-level governance experience and the deep knowledge of Asia and China that Jack has accumulated throughout his career,” Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said in a news release.

Before joining HSBC, Mr. Lake spent 17 years at Merrill Lynch in New York, Hong Kong and London, including running its Asian debt origination business. Mr. Tai is the fourth director to join HSBC’s board this year as the insurer has begun searching for a successor to Mr. Flint. David Nish, the former chief executive of Standard Life, joined the board in May. Paul Walsh, the former chief executive of the spirits maker Diageo, and Henri de Castries, the chairman and chief executive of the French insurer AXA, joined the board earlier this year. Mr. de Castries retired from AXA this month. The addition of Mr. Tai came as HSBC has moved in the last 15 months to significantly reshape its business by shedding tens of thousands of jobs, by selling underperforming businesses and shrinking its global investment banking business. The bank has faced pressure on its results in recent quarters, including difficult markets to begin the year and uncertainty following Britain’s decision to leave the European Union in June.
