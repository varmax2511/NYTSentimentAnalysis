The quarterly results — which included a gain on the sale of its holdings in Visa Europe, charges related to the overhaul of its business and provisions for legal matters — showed a profit of $2.61 billion, compared with $4.36 billion the year before.

It is hard to see a path to victory for Philippe P. Dauman, once a longtime confidant of Sumner M. Redstone, Steven Davidoff Solomon writes. The litigation should be settled with some face-saving measures for Mr. Dauman and George Abrams, another director. Advertisement Mr. Dauman has already held talks about leaving Viacom and settling litigation with National Amusements, according to Bloomberg, which cites a person with knowledge of the matter. The report also says that Mr. Abrams does not want to settle. In the meantime, Mr. Redstone’s grandaughter, Keryn Redstone, has also jumped into the legal fray.
