David Nish, who was the chief executive of Standard Life from 2010 to 2015, will join as an independent director in May. “David brings considerable relevant experience in financial services as well as in financial accounting and reporting,” Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said in a news release. “His tenure at Standard Life was marked by business transformation delivering value creation, a combination which HSBC is similarly targeting from its current strategy,” Mr. Flint added.

The bank, which is based in London but generates about half of its profit in Asia, hopes to find a successor by next year. The new chairman would then lead the search for a replacement for Stuart Gulliver, the bank’s chief executive.

He will be the third director to join HSBC’s board this year, after Paul Walsh, the former chief executive of the spirits maker Diageo, and Henri de Castries, the chairman and chief executive of the French insurer AXA. Mr. de Castries announced on Monday that he planned to retire this year.
