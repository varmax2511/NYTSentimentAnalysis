Pay increases will go forward in 2016, but a hiring freeze will remain in place, the bank’s chief executive, Stuart T. Gulliver, said in a memo to employees on Thursday. HSBC unveiled plans to freeze hiring and pay in January, but it decided to reinstate pay increases after receiving feedback from employees, the memo said. The pay increases will come from the company’s bonus pool, which will pay in 2017 bonuses for performance in 2016, the memo said. Bonus payments this year, for work in 2015, are not affected. HSBC, which is based in London but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, has begun significant cost-cutting efforts, like many of its European banking rivals. The lender wants to cut its costs by $5 billion annually by the end of 2017.
