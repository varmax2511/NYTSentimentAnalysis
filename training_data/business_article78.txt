Advertisement By CHAD BRAYNOV. 13, 2015  LONDON — HSBC said on Friday that it would add the chairman of the French insurer AXA and the former chief executive of the spirits maker Diageo to its board of directors next year. The bank, which is based in Britain but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, said that Paul Walsh, the former chief executive of Diageo, will join its board in January and that Henri de Castries, the chairman and chief executive of AXA, will join in March. Both will be independent directors. “The appointments of Henri de Castries and Paul Walsh bring substantial additional strength to the HSBC Board,” Douglas Flint, the HSBC chairman, said in a news release. “Their extensive international business experience and track record in shaping growing businesses, including undertaking business portfolio realignments, will further strengthen the existing skills on the HSBC board.” The appointments came as three directors are preparing to leave the board. Safra A. Catz, the chief executive of Oracle, will step down from the HSBC board at the end of this year. Rona Fairhead, the chairwoman of the BBC Trust, and Simon Robertson, the deputy chairman of HSBC, will retire from the board at the 2016 annual meeting. Heidi Miller, an independent nonexecutive director at HSBC and the former president of JPMorgan Chase’s international business, will assume Ms. Fairhead’s responsibilities as chairwoman of HSBC North America at the end of this year. After the changes, HSBC’s board will consist of 14 independent directors, three executive directors and a full-time chairman. We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think.
