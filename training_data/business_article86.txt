Advertisement By CHAD BRAYNOV. 2, 2015  LONDON —  HSBC said on Monday that its third-quarter profit had jumped 52 percent as it benefited from lower legal and regulatory costs and gains in its investment bank. The lender, which is based in Britain but generates more than half of its earnings in Asia, said it had also been helped by gains related to the value of its own debt. HSBC announced plans this year to cut its costs and reshape itself to improve its profitability. The bank said in June that it planned to shed up to 50,000 jobs, sell several underperforming businesses and shrink its global investment banking business. “Our cost-reduction measures are beginning to have an impact on our cost base,” Stuart Gulliver, the HSBC chief executive, said on Monday in a news release.

On a pretax basis, the bank reported a profit of $6.1 billion. That was ahead of analysts’ estimates, according to Reuters. As part of its results, HSBC sought to reassure investors on the quality of its loan portfolio in Asia, given a recent slowdown in the region, particularly in China. “Despite slowing growth in the mainland Chinese economy and market volatility in Asia, there has been no visible impact on our Asian credit quality” in the third quarter, the lender said. The bank also gave investors an update on its review of whether to move its headquarters from London, saying “a significant amount of work has been carried out.” The lender announced plans in April to review the location of its headquarters as it faces a tougher regulatory environment in Britain. “Whilst the target for completion of the review was initially set as by the end of 2015, this is a self-imposed deadline that can be moved should the board require further work to be performed,” the bank said. “An announcement will be made when the board makes its final decision and, if necessary, a further update will be provided at the time of the full-year results announcement.”  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

HSBC, which was founded as the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1865 in Hong Kong, moved its headquarters to Britain in 1993 after its acquisition of Midland Bank. The lender has reviewed whether to shift its headquarters in the past, but has chosen to stay in Britain. Revenue declined 4 percent to $15.1 billion in the third quarter, from $15.8 billion in the period a year earlier. Advertisement Net interest income, the measure of what a bank earns on its lending after deducting what it pays out on deposits and other liabilities, declined 8 percent to $8.03 billion in the period, from $8.75 billion in the third quarter of 2014. Operating expenses fell 19 percent to $9.04 billion in the third quarter, from $11.1 billion in the same period a year earlier. During the quarter, the bank recorded $202 million in costs for legal settlements and fines and to compensate consumers in Britain for improperly sold products, including so-called payment protection insurance. That compared with $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2014. The bank also recorded $28 million in costs in connection with regulatory requirements that the bank change its structure to shield retail banking operations from the effects of investment banking and other activities in the event of another financial crisis — a process known as ring fencing. Those requirements take effect in 2019. Barclays, a British banking rival, said last week that it expected to record about $1.5 billion in costs over the next three years to carry out structural changes to its operations to meet new regulatory requirements in Britain and the United States. Pretax profit in HSBC’s investment bank, known as global banking and markets, rose to $2.14 billion in the third quarter, from $941 million in the same period a year earlier. Those third-quarter 2014 results included $957 million in charges for legal settlements and fines. That included charges related to a $550 million settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency in the United States over mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Pretax profit in its commercial banking business was down 3 percent to $2.23 billion in the quarter, from $2.3 billion in the period a year earlier. In its retail and wealth management business, pretax profit declined 11 percent to $1.16 billion in the period, from $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014.
