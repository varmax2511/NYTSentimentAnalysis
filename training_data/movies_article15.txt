Disney and Marvel's latest collaboration earned $112.5 million from 4,474 locations in its second frame. The 56 percent decline was just enough to top the record previously held by fellow Marvel title "Black Panther," which made $111.6 million in its second weekend. "Star Wars: The Force Awakens" holds the prize for biggest second weekend, with a mighty $149 million in 2015. Only five films have ever hit the $100 million-mark in their second weekends. In just North America, the superhero mashup has made $450.8 million. Among "Infinity War's" numerous accomplishments is being the fastest film to gross $1 billion, in just 11 days. And the film has yet to open in China. One of three weekend releases opening in "Infinity War's" almighty wake is "Overboard," anchoring in the second spot with a solid $14 million in 1,623 theaters. The MGM and Lionsgate Pantelion remake of Goldie Hawn-Kurt Russell's classic romcom of the same name now stars Anna Faris and Eugenio Derbez. That three-day estimate washes in slightly ahead of Derbez's last leading role, "How to be a Latin Lover," which bowed with $12 million in 2017. "Overboard" is currently averaging a bleak 30 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. The audience score, however, is faring better with a 76 percent. Advertisement Slipping to No. 3 in its fifth weekend is Paramount Picture's "A Quiet Place." John Krasinski's horror thriller made $7.5 million in 3,413 locations, bringing its domestic total to an impressive $159.8 million. The third weekend of Amy Schumer's "I Feel Pretty" secured the fourth slot with $4.9 million from 3,232 theaters. Its North American tally currently sits at $37.8 million. Rounding out the top five is Dwayne Johnson's "Rampage." The Warner Bros. film grossed $4.6 million in 3,151 locations. In four weeks, its domestic total is $84.7 million.
