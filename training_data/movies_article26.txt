The Walt Disney Co. said Saturday that the Marvel superhero saga had earned just under $975 million in global box office through Friday. Since the film earned nearly $70 million on Friday alone, the studio is confident it will pass the billion-dollar mark on Saturday, in 11 days. The previous record of fastest time for a movie to make a $1 billion was 12 days for "Star Wars: The Force Awakens." The star-stuffed "Infinity Wars" features Robert Downey Jr., Benedict Cumberbatch, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chadwick Boseman, whose "Black Panther" movie has made more than $1.3 billion and remains in theaters. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the film's title is "Avengers: Infinity War" not "Avengers: Infinity Wars."
