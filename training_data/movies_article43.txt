Advertisement By BRUCE FRETTSAPRIL 24, 2018  Seemingly one of the only Marvel characters who’s not in Disney’s soon-to-be-unleashed “Avengers: Infinity War,” Venom is getting his own stand-alone film from Columbia Pictures. That’s because the Sony-owned studio controls the rights to the Spider-Man universe, which is where Venom originated. But Sony made a deal with Marvel Studios to share Spidey, which is why Tom Holland can be seen slinging webs in “Infinity War.” Confused yet? Venom’s origin story — as dramatized in the new trailer — isn’t quite so convoluted. An investigative journalist, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy), discovers that the diabolical Dr. Carlton Drake (Riz Ahmed) is doing research with symbiotes, organisms that can merge with people and create superhuman hybrids. Eddie soon finds his body invaded by one of these creatures and battles to use his new powers for good, not evil. The film also features Michelle Williams in her first superhero-movie role as Eddie’s ex-wife. Also making her Marvel debut: the “Saturday Night Live” alumna Jenny Slate as a do-gooder who asks Eddie to aid in an attempt to defeat Drake. “Embrace your inner antihero,” the trailer’s tagline reads, and Sony hopes moviegoers will do just that when “Venom” hits theaters on Oct. 5.
