Advertisement By BRUCE FRETTSMAY 1, 2018  The new trailer for “Ant-Man and the Wasp” is set to the tune of Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock’s hip-hop classic “It Takes Two,” and the titular superheroes played by Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly do seem to make a dynamic duo. In this sequel to the 2015 hit “Ant-Man,” the escaped convict Scott Lang and the scientist’s daughter Hope Van Dyne reassume their insect identities and team up with Scott’s former cellmate (Michael Peña) to battle a ghostlike villain who has stolen the technology that allows them to shrink or grow exponentially. A preview of the film. Striking a lighter tone than Marvel’s current blockbuster “Avengers: Infinity War,” the comic adventure sees its crimefighters utilizing unlikely weapons like a giant saltshaker to stop their foes. One of them is played by Walton Goggins, who was also cast as a bad guy in this year’s “Tomb Raider” and appears briefly in the trailer. There’s no sign of Michelle Pfeiffer as Hope’s mom, Janet Van Dyne, a.k.a. the Original Wasp, but since her husband Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) opens up the Quantum Realm where she’s been trapped, it seems certain she’ll appear in the film. “You go low, I go high,” Ant-Man suggests to the Wasp, who logically replies, “I have wings — why would I go low?” Marvel Studios hopes to reach box-office heights when “Ant-Man and the Wasp” lands in theaters on July 6.
