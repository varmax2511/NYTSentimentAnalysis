President Trump has shown a lot of affection for Emmanuel Macron during the French president’s visit to the White House this week. His handshakes seem to last a little too long, fingers get tangled, cheek-kisses flow abundantly. The late-night hosts rolled the tapes and let the jokes fly. “Have you ever seen him touch anyone like that? He gave him the full Stormy Daniels there.” — JIMMY KIMMEL “When President Emmanuel Macron greeted President Trump, he kissed Trump on both cheeks. Then out of habit, Michael Cohen showed up and handed Macron $130,000.” — CONAN O’BRIEN One incident was a little less affectionate, but at least as awkward: Standing next to Macron, Trump told reporters he’d found dandruff on the French leader’s jacket. “Mr. President, Macron is still standing next to you, smiling, after hanging out with you for two days. That’s not dandruff — that’s cocaine.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “It is Trump’s first state dinner, and in a major departure from tradition, Trump will not invite Democrats or the media. It’s true, none of those people are invited. If he doesn’t like you, you will not be there. Better luck next time, vegetables — they’re serving tacos tonight.” — STEPHEN COLBERT At one point in the visit Trump appeared to be trying to hold his wife, Melania’s, hand, while she avoided contact. “She is not having it, man. He is like trying to rouse a dead trout. You can’t blame her, though. I mean, she watches ‘60 Minutes,’ she knows where that hand has been.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Advertisement Dr. Ronny L. Jackson’s nomination to lead the Veterans Affairs Department has hit a major roadblock, with a number of serious accusations emerging against him in recent days. “Dr. Ronny Jackson is being accused of overseeing a hostile workplace, overprescribing drugs and even drinking on the job. Then again, I gotta say, I think I’d have a drink, too, if I had to check Donald Trump’s prostate.” — JAMES CORDEN “The White House did little or no vetting of his background before announcing his nomination on Twitter. The White House staff meant to vet him, but they were high on pills they got from some doctor who works there.” — STEPHEN COLBERT Advertisement “This movie ‘Infinity War’ is Part 1 of a two-part culmination of 18 films in the Marvel cinematic universe — which makes it the longest committed relationship most comic book fans have ever had. It’s meaningful.” — JIMMY KIMMEL, discussing the “Avengers” film series “Amazon, this is getting weird. You’re slipping into our lives in ways no one’s asking you to. I’m afraid the next time I order underwear I’ll get a message saying, ‘Look down. We already put them on you.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT, on Amazon’s new service offering deliveries directly to the trunks of customers’ cars “The internet just erupted after Melania Trump was photographed wearing a Beyoncé-style hat. Yeah, and just like Beyoncé, Melania’s recording an album about her cheating husband. True story, it’s called ‘Orangeade.’” — CONAN O’BRIEN “The Daily Show” imagined Trump’s hand as a hungry shark. Either “The Tonight Show” was feeding him the answers, or Questlove really, really, really knows Prince’s music. A couple of late-night hosts will be paying visits to their colleagues on Wednesday: Jimmy Fallon will sit down with Seth Meyers, and Jim Jefferies — host of a weekly talk show on Comedy Central — will be on “Conan.” Meek Mill, the Philadelphia rapper whose case has become symbolic of the movement for racial equality in the criminal justice system, was just released on bail.
