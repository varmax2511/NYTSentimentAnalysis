The comedian Michelle Wolf has worked on both “The Daily Show” and “Late Night,” so Trevor Noah and Seth Meyers were not surprised by the rough-riding, profane speech she gave at the White House correspondents’ dinner on Saturday. The speech has drawn criticism for its unapologetic attacks on President Trump and, in particular, jokes involving Sarah Huckabee Sanders’s makeup (Wolf said her eye shadow was made of “burnt facts”). Noah and Meyers saw little cause for outrage — especially given Trump’s own history of commenting crudely on women’s appearances — and they swept to Ms. Wolf’s defense on Monday. “She is filthy and she is mean — which is what we love about her. Because those are wonderful qualities for comedians, and terrible qualities for free-world leaders.” — SETH MEYERS, comparing Michelle Wolf with President Trump “Michelle should have had the decency not to comment on women’s appearances in any way, shape or form. She’s a comedian, for God’s sake, not the president.” — TREVOR NOAH Noah feigned anger at Wolf — who left “The Daily Show” months ago to host her own program on Netflix — and told her that she was retroactively “fired.” “I agree completely with President Trump and his team: Comedians should be held to a higher standard than he is. Which is why even though Michelle Wolf left for her new show four months ago, tonight I’m announcing that I’m officially firing her. You hear that, Michelle? You’re fired!” — TREVOR NOAH Advertisement Meyers was especially bothered by the fact that the White House Correspondents’ Association, which hired Wolf for the evening, put out a statement denouncing Wolf. It said her statements were “not in the spirit” of the event. “You hired her! That’s like a parent sending an email saying, ‘Yesterday’s birthday was meant to celebrate Kevin turning 6 years old. Unfortunately the stripper’s dance routine was not in the spirit of the party.’” — SETH MEYERS Advertisement On “The Late Show,” Stephen Colbert recalled hosting the correspondents’ dinner in 2006, when he told intensely sharp-edged jokes at President George W. Bush’s expense. Colbert got back into the character that he used to play back then — an over-the-top conservative commentator — and opined about Wolf’s performance on Saturday. “I’ve been busy collaborating with Kanye West on an album of Republican hip-hop. It’s called ‘My Beautiful Dark Twisted Reality.’” — STEPHEN COLBERT “I want to congratulate Michelle Wolf for being so lucky to have me Steve-splain everything she did wrong.” — STEPHEN COLBERT “This is the correspondents’ dinner, celebrating the freedom of speech; you can’t just say whatever you want!” — STEPHEN COLBERT “How dare you besmirch the O.K. name of Sarah Huckabee Sanders?” — STEPHEN COLBERT “I am so proud, right down to the breastbone, that the press is defending her despite the fact that her boss joked about throwing reporters in jail. That’s the kind of comedy the press likes!” — STEPHEN COLBERT, on Sarah Huckabee Sanders “Saturday was the White House correspondents’ dinner, and Trump called it ‘a very big, boring bust.’ This was the first time in history Trump has called a big bust boring.” — JIMMY FALLON “The royal family just announced the name of William and Kate’s newborn son, Louis Arthur Charles. I guess they couldn’t decide on a royal-sounding name, so they just went with all of them.” — JIMMY FALLON “Stormy Daniels is suing President Trump for defamation for something he said in a tweet. When they heard this, Muslims, African-Americans, gays and Hillary Clinton said, ‘You can do that?’” — CONAN O’BRIEN “This could be a bigly victory for President Trump. The president of South Korea said he thinks Trump should win a Nobel Prize for Peace. ‘Hairpiece,’ he said — but that’s in the translation.” — JIMMY KIMMEL, on the peace talks underway between North and South Korea These records are atrocious. If you thought Michelle Wolf was making fun of people viciously, check out how these random Twitter users talk about the Avengers stars. Jimmy Kimmel’s two guests on Tuesday night are both big-ticket names, but they come from opposite ends of the cultural spectrum: Miley Cyrus and Senator Elizabeth Warren. What are they going to talk about? Our chief TV critic doesn’t share the feeling of outrage held by Wolf’s dissenters. He writes that her speech “was scathing, confrontational and impolite. It was, in other words, about what you’d expect from a correspondent who once called President Trump ‘a racist fake gynecologist.’” We’re interested in your feedback on this page.
