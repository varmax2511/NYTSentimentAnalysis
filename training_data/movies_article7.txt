Advertisement By BRUCE FRETTSMARCH 16, 2018  Don’t blink or you’ll miss one of more than a dozen superheroes featured in the new trailer for “Avengers: Infinity War.” Marvel’s all-star adventure brings together not only Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) from the Avengers, but also the Guardians of the Galaxy (Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord, Zoe Saldana’s Gamora, Bradley Cooper’s Rocket and Vin Diesel’s Groot) and — oh yeah — Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), whose stand-alone movie has grossed more than half a billion dollars in the United States alone. Apparently it will take these combined superpowers and more to overcome the threat of Thanos (Josh Brolin, who’ll play a different character in Marvel’s forthcoming “Deadpool” sequel). The villain is on a quest to collect the six Infinity Stones, which will allow him to wipe out half the population of the universe. Directed by the brothers Anthony and Joe Russo, who also oversaw the 2016 smash “Captain America: Civil War,” the latest Avengers installment looks to incorporate some of the cheeky humor that has set Marvel titles like “Guardians of the Galaxy” and “Deadpool” apart from the more serious films of its rival, DC Comics. After Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) introduces himself to Peter Parker (Tom Holland), the web-slinger quips, “Oh, we’re using our made-up names? Then I am Spider-Man.” (For the record, the doctor’s real name is Stephen Vincent Strange.) “Let’s talk about this plan of yours,” Star-Lord says to Iron Man. “I think it’s good, except it sucks.” Disney and Marvel hope moviegoers will feel more positively about “Avengers: Infinity War” when it lands in theaters on April 27.
