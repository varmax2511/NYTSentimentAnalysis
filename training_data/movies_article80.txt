Advertisement  Here and Now  By                      JUDY BERMAN  APRIL 2, 2018  Finally, Duc Bayer-Boatwright gets his moment in the sun. Don’t get too excited; it’s not that he has a psychological breakthrough or stops being a jerk or even has a particularly substantial story line in this week’s episode of “Here and Now.” For the second week in a row, he’s gritting his teeth through a colitis flare-up — and Ramon’s poop jokes aren’t helping. Duc’s big scene takes place during a hike with his love interest, Carmen. Doubled over in pain, he gets so frantic about finding a place to relieve himself that he falls down a hill and exits the date in an ambulance. Duc is, in other words, as hapless as ever in Episode 8. But that makes him the ideal avatar for this week’s theme, as revealed in Greg’s lecture. As an introduction to a lesson on “The Myth of Sisyphus,” Albert Camus’s essay on embracing the absurdity of a meaningless life over suicide, Professor Boatwright alarms his students by pressing a gun to his chin and demanding a reason not to pull the trigger. By persisting, he explains, “We become the absurdist hero, seeking meaning we know is not there, living life to its fullest in the face of a consistent and continuous struggle and inevitable failure.” When the stunt ends in an involuntary six-month leave, the irony is that Greg’s message to students was actually pretty life affirming, for once. Sisyphus, a character from Greek mythology, was condemned to spend eternity pushing a boulder up a hill, only to watch it fall each time to the bottom. Grim as that fate may seem, Camus reframes Sisyphus as an absurdist hero, scrambling fruitlessly but nobly to make meaning for as long as he can keep the rock that is his life rolling. “The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man’s heart,” Camus writes in the essay’s famous conclusion. “One must imagine Sisyphus happy.” Considering that few afflictions scream absurdity like a benign yet incurable bout of diarrhea, I assume there’s some symbolism in Duc’s tumble down the hill. Usually, Ramon and Audrey are the show’s great rock pushers, fighting tirelessly for empathy in a world that keeps knocking it down in favor of fear. But this week, both characters take some time off from their respective forms of martyrdom. Audrey, who is always there to comfort and nag her husband and children, skips a family dinner to consummate her flirtation with Steve. (She can thank Ashley for giving her the sexy heels that catch his eye.) Arriving at home next morning, she takes pleasure in informing a gloomy Greg of her conquest. Advertisement Ramon, for his part, hasn’t been the same since his hallucination at the video game expo. After blowing up at Farid, he flees his parents’ house for his own apartment and buries his sorrows over his deteriorating mental health (and perhaps his uncertain future as a game designer) in casual sex. “I feel fire,” Carmen, who comes across as a sort of New Age palm reader, tells him in their first session. She also mentions that he’s heading for “big changes” and prods him about a mysterious near-death experience. Advertisement When her intuition comes up short, she assures Ramon, “The answers are in you.” Whether she knows it or not, she’s likely referring to his game and his therapy with Farid — neither of which look especially promising by the end of the episode. Farid seems to be approaching a breaking point. His dreams are haunted by butterflies. He’s seeing 11:11 everywhere. Out to dinner with Layla, he flies into a rage when the host asks her to remove her head scarf. And he’s become so desperate for insight into his psychic connection with Ramon that he violates doctor-patient confidentiality by appealing to Audrey for help. Still convinced that her son is schizophrenic, she decides that Farid has come unglued and orders him to stay away from Ramon.  Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Later in the episode, there’s an awkward encounter at the store his uncle Amir used to own. Propelled by a dream involving the store, Farid stops by for the first time in quite a while. The shop’s new owner recognizes him and saddles him with a box of things Amir left behind. Inside, Farid finds an answering machine that he remembers from childhood, along with a tape. When he plays it, he hears what we can assume is his mother’s voice. This is huge: Decades before, she had tried to contact him, but Amir lied to keep him from picking up the phone. Ramon’s and Farid’s mothers, who are prominent in their visions, clearly play a significant role in whatever connection the characters have to each other. So, if Farid manages to find some answers about his mom, those revelations could have major implications for both men — and for the show’s supernatural plot, which is still creeping along at a frustratingly slow pace. At least we’ve got Kristen and Navid, whose quest to get even with Madison results in some satisfying mean-girl screams and a triumphant kiss between the two masked avengers. Like Ramon, they are among the show’s best characters because their story lines revolve around who they are as individuals, rather than their identity markers. (Pity Ashley, whose slightly unbelievable confrontation with a middle-aged, white, male Black Lives Matter activist drives her to the gun range.) I love that Navid is attracted to girls, despite being drawn to women’s clothing and makeup, and that his quiet iconoclasm seems to electrify the chronically bored Kristen. With only two episodes left in the season, “Here and Now” is going to have to cover a lot of ground to provide a satisfying finale. The future of Greg and Audrey’s marriage remains uncertain; Farid and Layla’s relationship is also starting to look pretty fragile. The story of Ramon and Henry feels unfinished. Ashley and Duc have yet to become fully fleshed-out characters. Wonderful as they are together, Navid and Kristen are fighting a war with Madison that comes straight out of a teen comedy and isn’t really connected yet with the rest of the show. Most of all, even if we don’t get a full explanation of the connection between Ramon and Farid, we’ve got to have something more than just these dreams and hallucinations, which are becoming redundant. We need the show to stop throwing philosophical theories at us and start sketching out a distinctive point of view. Greg’s lecture suggests that it is possible to find some fleeting semblance of meaning in an indifferent universe. “Here and Now” may not have a cure for our modern ailments, but it could at least give us a reason to keep pushing that boulder up the hill.
