(TCM) DIRECTED BY LUIS BUÑUEL This five-film tribute to Buñuel (1900-1983), known as the father of Surrealist cinema, begins with “Belle de Jour” (1968), starring Catherine Deneuve (above right, with Geneviève Page) as a frigid young housewife able to achieve sexual satisfaction only after becoming a prostitute. Writing in The New York Times, Renata Adler called “Belle de Jour” “a really beautiful movie, and somehow, letting the color in — this is Buñuel’s first color film — has changed the emotional quality of his obsessions in a completely unpredictable way.” In “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie” (1972), an Oscar-winner for best foreign film, at 10, six upwardly mobile friends try to have dinner together — but find they can’t. “In addition to being extraordinarily funny and perfectly acted,” Vincent Canby wrote, “ ‘The Discreet Charm’ moves with the breathtaking speed and self-assurance that only a man of Buñuel’s experience can achieve without resorting to awkward ellipsis.” The lineup continues with “Diary of a Chambermaid” (1964), an adaptation of the novel by Octave Mirbeau about the foibles and hypocrisy of the landed gentry as seen through the eyes of a worldly domestic (Jeanne Moreau), at midnight; “Viridiana” (1962), in which a young nun (Silvia Pinal) tries to help the poor after inheriting a fortune, at 2 a.m.; and “The Exterminating Angel” (1962), where guests at a lavish dinner party in an elegant home in Mexico City find themselves unable to leave the parlor for several days, during which the social order begins to break down, at 3:45. 8 P.M.
