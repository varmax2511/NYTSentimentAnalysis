Good Monday morning from Washington, where the Redskins haven’t made the Super Bowl since the 1991 season, but where there’s always a home team on Capitol Hill. Leading the news: President Obama unveils his budget today. He is also talking about how a book of short stories by a Marine veteran has influenced his thinking on America’s wars. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has a book of his own, which he is promoting in early primary states, and Mitch McConnell’s promotion to majority leader seems to have brought out the lighter side of the Kentucky senator. A come-from-behind victory, a last-minute interception, an end-zone fight. Super Bowls don’t get much more exciting. Right? Speak up, potential presidential candidates. That’s what Twitter is for. What’s that? Nothing to say? You might excuse Republicans for showing little enthusiasm for a game in which both teams were from states that are reliably Democratic. But still, one of the teams is named the Patriots. That was enough for Sarah Palin, who posted on Twitter an image of New England’s coach, Bill Belichick, wearing a “Don’t Tread on Me” T-shirt on his way into the stadium. “That is ALL good…” she wrote. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a noted fan of the Dallas (Haven’t Been to the Super Bowl in 19 Years) Cowboys, admitted that he was watching the game, although he was “Watching #SuperBowlXLIX at The Albion Pub in London with a few @RutgersUexchange students.” And Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was promoting his Rand 2016 “Liberty footballs,” the triangular paper kind. But the others? Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania was promoting book signings, former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas was asking his Twitter followers to help him “end the IRS,” and Mitt Romney has not posted on the social media network since announcing on Friday that he would not join the presidential race. The official accounts of Ben Carson, former Gov. Jeb Bush of the football-mad Florida, former Gov. Rick Perry of the football-mad Texas, Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina all went silent. But what did Senator Marco Rubio of Florida mean when he wrote: “Who will win the #SuperBowl? Retweet for Patriots, favorite for Seahawks”? It wasn’t any different on the Democratic side, although there were far fewer Twitter feeds to check. The sports fan in Hillary Rodham Clinton was on display, but it was in a Twitter tribute to the late Ernie Banks, a Chicago Cubs legend, on Jan. 24. — Steve Kenny President Obama rolls out his $4 trillion budget on Monday, although the multivolume spending plan is more likely to be used as a doorstop by Republicans on Capitol Hill than as a starting point for a budget of their own. The fiscal plan allows Mr. Obama to lay out his priorities with a menu of initiatives that seek to rally Democrats around him. It is also the necessary first step to any agreement with the Republican majority in Congress on federal spending for 2016 and beyond. Republicans have been clear that they want nothing to do with the president’s proposals on a program to make community college tuition-free for millions, new taxes on wealthy Americans and higher fees on big banks. And most oppose the administration’s proposal to increase financing for domestic agencies, though there is Republican support for plans to provide more money for the Pentagon. For the first time since Mr. Obama took office, Republicans will be responsible for producing a budget in both the House and Senate. They have said that passing a spending plan that balances the budget within a decade will be evidence of their ability to govern, so it would be a major setback for the Republicans if they fail to come to an agreement among themselves. And while the president doesn’t sign the congressional budget, he will have to agree to the spending bills and other policy initiatives that grow out of it. So while Republicans are unhappy with the president’s plan, they may ultimately have to give him some of what he wants, so they can get some of what they want. — Carl Hulse One of the books President Obama read on his December vacation was “Redeployment,” a collection of short stories by Phil Klay about the war in Iraq. Mr. Klay, a former Marine who served in Iraq, writes “of brutality and faith, guilt and fear, helplessness and survival,” according to the author’s website. The book was a “painful” reminder, the president said on Sunday, that his decisions as commander in chief have consequences for the men and women serving in America’s wars. “The antiseptic plans and decisions and strategies, and the opining of pundits that take place in Washington, you know, is very different from war and conflict as it’s experienced by people on the ground,” Mr. Obama said in recommending the book during an interview on CNN’s “Fareed Zakaria GPS.” Mr. Obama used the discussion of Mr. Klay’s book to vent about the political climate in Washington, taking on columnists and editorial writers and making a veiled swipe at congressional hawks who have pushed him for years to be more aggressive overseas. “We can’t play political games, and we can’t engage in bluster or reaction or, you know, try to beat our chests when we make these decisions,” he said. “If we’re going to deploy folks to war, it better be for a darn good reason, and we better have a very clear objective that is worthy of the sacrifices that these folks make.” — Michael D. Shear Senator Marco Rubio’s book tour this month looks a lot like campaign barnstorming through states with early primaries and caucuses. The Florida Republican will hit the road during the congressional recess to promote his book “American Dreams,” with stops at Barnes & Noble stores in West Des Moines, Iowa (Feb. 13); Las Vegas (Feb. 18); Greenville, S.C. (Feb. 19) and Manchester, N.H. (Feb. 23). That means stops in four states that are among the first on the Republican nominating calendar. This is not a coincidence. Even his staff says so. “Senator Rubio has said he is seriously considering running for president, and his schedule this month reflects that,” said Alex Conant, a Rubio spokesman. “As he meets with people across the country, he is sharing his new ideas to confront 21st-century problems. His goal is to pass new reforms so that more people can achieve the American dream.” Mr. Rubio has made room for fund-raising events between book signings in places like Texas and Chicago. And Anna Rogers, who previously worked with the Karl Rove group American Crossroads, starts her job with Team Rubio on Monday as finance director at his Reclaim America PAC — just in time for the tour. — Ashley Parker The release of President Obama’s budget for the 2016 fiscal year. In its latest attempt to undercut the Affordable Care Act, the House Rules Committee takes up a bill to repeal the health law. The full House will vote on the bill as early as Tuesday. The SANS Institute holds a meeting on cyberthreat intelligence with experts from the F.B.I., the Department of Homeland Security, private industry and policy groups. The Atlantic Council presents a report on what the United States and NATO must do to preserve Ukraine’s independence. The Commerce Department releases personal income and spending numbers for December, and the Institute for Supply Management releases its manufacturing index for January. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky isn’t known for sparkling wit or a sharp sense of humor, but guests at an exclusive Alfalfa Club dinner said both were on display Saturday night at the Capitol Hilton in Washington. Mr. McConnell took shots at himself; at Mitt Romney, a new club member; and at his Senate colleagues. Witnesses said he even roused the audience by expressing a willingness to work with the president on immigration policy. The new majority leader acknowledged that he faced challenges from both the left and right in running the Senate, noting that Senator Ted Cruz of Texas had said he was willing to throw himself in front of a train to repeal the new health care law. “That idea has some merit to it,” Mr. McConnell cracked. — Carl Hulse President Obama’s budget focuses on policies to address income inequality. The United States is considering a plan to arm Ukraine’s military forces. Fighting there continues. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey finds his star power doesn’t pack much heat in London. Wisconsin’s state treasurer is making good on a campaign promise: He has dismissed his entire staff and is working on eliminating his own job. Despite the Ebola scare last fall, a clinical trial in Liberia of a drug to treat the disease has been called off because of a shortage of patients. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin stands to be the biggest beneficiary of Mitt Romney’s withdrawal, Politico says. Vox thinks so, too.The latest Des Moines Register opinion poll has Mr. Walker leading the field in Iowa, a year before the caucuses there. The New Yorker says that Pope Francis is complicating the presidential aspirations of the three Catholics on the Republican shortlist: Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida. (The rest of the Bushes may not be Catholic, but Jeb’s wife is, and he converted to Catholicism.) Dana Milbank of The Washington Post says that Senator Bernard Sanders of Vermont “doesn’t seem inclined to be a Ralph Nader,” and that he would probably run as a Democrat if he were to seek the presidency. The National Journal rounds up the most ridiculous PAC names heading into the 2016 race. The Secret Service arrested and charged a man with unlawful entry after he climbed atop a bicycle rack outside the White House grounds, The Associated Press reports. Like the Politics Newsletter?
