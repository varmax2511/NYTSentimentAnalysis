Advertisement  Current Events Conversation  By                      THE LEARNING NETWORK  JAN. 25, 2018  Every week your contributions to our site seem to get more thoughtful — and every week we’re delighted to see loyal schools (shout-out to Wilmington, N.C.!) show up, as well as welcome new ones. This week, for instance, we have student comments from Momence, Ill., and Perry, Fla. But we also want to spotlight the contributions of one person in particular: Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts, we love what you have to say, and we appreciate the interesting ways you say it. We seem to call Ms. Miraglia out every week, but this week she also starts us off, below, with a thoughtful post about America’s tangled relationship with race. Finally, though our weekly Film Club feature is not one of our writing prompts, and thus not part of what we capture in this feature, we want to note that the Jan. 12 edition, on the short film “Can Texting Save Lives,”  was popular with student commenters. We heard from Apopka, Fla.; Houston, Tex.; and Jefferson High School in Lafayette, La. Teachers, if your students regularly post to our writing prompts and are sometimes called out here, we’d love to hear what the experience has been like — for them and for you. This is a new feature this year, and we’re always seeking feedback. In fact, the email address to which you can write and tell us is LNFeedback@nytimes.com. Thank you in advance!

Advertisement _________ Our most popular prompt last week was “Is America ‘Backsliding’ on Race?” Students told us what they thought of the state of race relations, and if the presidency of Donald Trump has affected them one way or another. Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts thinks America always had a dark side: I don’t think that America is “slipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself” - I think that America has always had a dark underbelly. Beneath apple pie, baseball, and the glitz and glamour of the “American dream”, there has always been a side that most Americans have the decency to be ashamed of. America was built on slavery and racism, but the credit was taken by Europeans.In school, we are learning about the eloquence of previous presidents. We read speeches by Lincoln and marvel at how he was able to say things in such a precise and careful way. In present-day America, we read tweets by our child-president and marvel and how he is able to command anxiety with just 180 characters.Racism has been ingrained into American society. Beyonce’s quote sums it up best. In a speech she gave when presenting Colin Kaepernick with the Muhammed Ali Legacy Award, she said, “...racism is so American, that when we protest racism, some assume we are protesting America.” She is right. America’s dark underbelly should be shamed, it should be the thing that we feel disgust towards, the thing that we apologize for and work to end. It should not be the thing that is passed down to our children. I see the uprisings of racism in high school, unfortunately - it’s not my classmates’ fault that some of them feign ignorance at what he says and does. It is America’s fault, it is society, it is generations and generations who failed us. Ava Lanning of Danvers, Mass., believes that individual actions matter most: Is America backsliding on race? No. Are individuals backsliding on race? Now that is a different story. I think as a whole, America has improved upon the way different races view one another and it confuses me as to why people think the America we live in today is slightly comparable to the “earlier, uglier” version. I agree with Sterling Tuckers statement on how there is not a lot of honesty in the country because of how everything has to be filtered. Everything needs to be politically correct. Some individuals have a hard time facing the truth. Who we are and where we are as a country is impossible to evaluate. Do I feel as if America is slipping into the earlier and uglier self? No, I do not. I think society is deliberately portraying races either as a target or privileged. All over social media whether the person is young or old, white or black, they have something political to say. Racism is a two way street. One race should not be at fault for being more “racist” than the other because wouldn’t that be considered racist too? Ever since Donald Trump has been elected, racism and political correctness have been the talk of the day. In my opinion, I think racism is on the rise, and there is nothing to do about it because of the way people have grown up and individually faced racism. Amiya Nelson from Illinois thinks racism is on the rise: I feel as if racism is on the rise we’ve had plenty of killings in the United States on the account of another race not liking African Americans and it’s not fair. Being a young African American lady I have experienced a lot of racism as I’ve gotten older from classmates to teachers to even cops an outsiders as well. I get on social media and run across racism. But its going to continue to be on the rise because Americans let this be acceptable. Payton James from Massachusetts wrote about hidden racism: Do I believe that America is “slipping into an earlier, uglier version of itself”? No. America has always been ugly, it’s just covered up. America has a foundation of prejudice, and many minorities suffer from this today. The fact that black children need to be taught to deal with the police before they learn how to read is ugly. Since the election of Trump, more people are following in our presidents footsteps in regards to voicing their opinions on ethnic minorities. I have certainly heard racial slurs in person, but where I see the most insensitive comments is on social media. I see people responding to Trump’s barbaric tweets about immigrants, people say that “Only REAL Americans should be here”. My response to that is that any of us who are black, white, or asian are not “real Americans”, we trace back to elsewhere. The only true Americans race was nearly decimated. In fact, the people who are often told to “go back to their country” are Mexicans and people from Central and South America. What many don’t understand is that people from these regions often have a fair amount Native American ancestry.Therefore, this is their country. They’re the “real Americans”. IN KOP PA feels racism is unfair: I believe that America is turning back “into an uglier version of itself” because it is the thought and idea that sticks to everyone. This idea and thought is thought one race is to be held lower than another on a scale. This is not fair because everyone is born equal, and to judge someone by their race and belief is disgusting. Donald Trump has made this idea stick with everyone and believe that this is the ‘way to make America great again’ and to get rid of the people that don’t belong. The people that don’t belong want a better life; in a better country; with better opportunities and the many people are in the way of making things right for them and their families. In this country and world everyone should belong no matter the race or belief. _________ Two comments for the prompt “Does Every Country Need a ‘Loneliness Minister’?” caught our eye this week. Cindy from California suggested we look around our own neighborhood: What London is doing is a great need of society today. Neighbors don’t talk to each and people just don’t care about each.Yeah we sure rescue whales and do something for all kinds of causes but do we know if our neighbor is sick ? How many people here in the last year or so have 1. Picked up medicines for a sick person 2. Consoled a grieving soul. 3. Sat with an elderly person 4. Sat with a friend and lent them an ear. We talk about all the big issues in the world but don’t we know what issues our next door neighbor is dealing with. And Bradly Boaz from Wilmington thinks small actions can go a long way toward alleviating loneliness: Anxiety, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even depression are all horrible illnesses that are recently proven to be derived from this common and quite frankly subtle disease known as loneliness. We all face it, whether it be the cause of losing a loved one or even just being away from those we love for a short period of time, loneliness never seems to go away. Young or old, friendly or shy, confident or afraid we are all exposed to this dangerous, illness creator, so why not arm ourselves against? In the U.K, they have decided to make a stand against the overwhelming statistics involving loneliness, and how more than 200,000 Britain face this feeling that is proven worse than smoking 15 cigarettes a day! The fight against this battle starts in the U.K with a minister for loneliness, but in the U.S, no action has been made. We have almost 5X as many residents as the U.K, and I will remind you that is more than 1 million recorded citizens facing extreme loneliness, and still no action. We arm ourselves against any other disease like the flu and different types of cancer, so why not try and fight loneliness. Just a group of people who care and want to make things right about the fact that so many people face the problem of feeling like they are alone in a massive lost world would make things right. Just one group … one difference maker. _________ Our Student Opinion question “Are Lavish Amenities on College Campuses Useful or Frivolous?” raised many good points on student debt, stress and college amenities. XxJayden Smith FanxX from Wilmington is adamantly against lavish amenities because they will increase student debt: I don’t plan on going to college so I can lounge around and sit in a lazy river, especially one that my friends and I paid 85 million dollars for. According to the article, tuition fees have gone up by 60 percent in the last five years. Now if that’s true; then I want to know whose genius idea it was to steal even more of the students’ money, but this time, for completely useless renovation projects. How could anyone in good faith, knowing make students pay for this stuff when they are probably already knee deep in debt. I truly hate seeing articles like this; because the only thing they really tell me is that I’m just going to be in debt for even longer after I get out of college. Anna Walker from Chicago said education should be the focus of college: I completely agree with the author of this article. Student debt is a huge problem in the US, and using money from student fees to pay for lavish amenities only drives up costs. College is meant to be a means of education and a place for students to learn about topics they are interested in, and students should be choosing schools based on whether or not that school has a program they are interested in, and not whether or not it has the nicest amenities. Colleges marketing themselves through having lazy rivers and climbing walls instead of academics aren’t helping. While it is true that students need to relax, having expensive amenities won’t make or break that–there’s plenty to do on campuses already Sydney from North Carolina thinks college would be more enjoyable: After perusing the article about the “top 25” in the nation, I believe that my answer is yes and no to this question. There are many things that you have to take into consideration while looking at a college to attend. In the beginning of this article, amenities provided by colleges seemed to be given a negative connotation. As I looked through the attached top 25 article, my opinion changed. Some extra amenities provided by colleges are of no importance, such as a lazy river or bowling alley. On the other hand, if you look at new classrooms and buildings and arts centers that are the center of attention of the campus, then these amenities will offer students a much more enjoyable experience when attending college. Having a brand new lab for a certain study in the field of science, or a new auditorium would give students in those areas an opportunity to embrace their true potential at college, where you get to study what you want and find your true self. Going to a college with amazing classrooms, labs, and arts facilities will make their experiences unforgettable and allow them to study what they want in the best provisions out there. AWD DC replied to Sydney from North Carolina, quoted above, and said: Watch out — it sounds like you’re falling into the same trap that the author warns about. When you use language like “find your true self” and “unforgettable experiences”, you’re falling for the marketing ploys that college admissions offices use to lure students into paying high tuition and taking on illogical amounts of debt. If you take both your coursework and your education seriously, your college experience will likely be unforgettable no matter what. College can be a wonderful time full of personal growth and exploration, but don’t idealize it too much. College will hopefully give you the chance to define and pursue your interests more deeply, and you may begin to develop some sense of what it is in life that you value, and therefore what kind of life you might begin to pursue. But “finding your true self” is not something you should expect higher ed to deliver.You’re right to distinguish between lazy rivers and new, upgraded laboratories. If you want to study sciences, that upgraded laboratory could provide valuable intellectual and professional opportunities, and if you want to study art, a new art gallery on campus may provide value. If your dream is to study history, though, you’re much better off valuing low student/professor ratios and expansive library access, though — not a fancy new humanities building. Be very discerning about what resources you actually need, and be realistic about what resources you’re likely to take advantage of. Sydney Durner Wilmington, N.C., thinks lavish amenities are unnecessary: There is no need for colleges to build lazy rivers for students. They may be nice to use, but college is already so expensive and lazy rivers should be the last thing students should have to pay for. At L.S.U., the $85 million lazy river was completely financed by student fees. This is not something they should have to use fees for when they’re already on a tight budget. Textbooks, tuition, and food costs add up.Adding these lavish amenities does increase popularity of these institutions, but that shouldn’t be their number one priority. They should be more focused on how affordable college is and their success rate. A student should chose to go to a college because they offer a pool, they should go there because the school offers amazing classes, fits what they want to major in, and because they provide all the resources they need to be successful. Clinton Davidson from Vallejo, Calif., answered succinctly: Lavish amenities attract students. But they also harden people against forgiving student loans. Maggie Yang of King of Prussia likes the stress-relieving aspect of some lavish amenities: I think that these lavish amenities could be very useful if used properly. College students work very hard to keep up with all of their classes and curriculum, and all of this can lead to extreme amounts of stress and anxiety. These amenities can be used to relieve stress and relax. Studies have found that making some relaxing time for yourself can actually increase the chances of you becoming successful. But Spring Chicken from Georgia, U.S.A., offered alternative, less expensive stress-relieving activities: Water parks are nice, but students, parents, alumni, and—yes, members of the school’s oversight board—should have better sense than to have their school provide those kinds of perks. Students, why not take a stress-relieving bicycle ride to the beach, or a weekend camping trip up in the mountains? Campus leaders, why not allow local businesses that provide (safe) recreational facilities free on-campus advertising of some off-campus activities? (Outsourcing these fun amenities also reduces the school’s liability should a student get hurt—admins, are you listening?) If I were a college student today, then the last thing I’d want to do to relax is hang out on the same campus that’s causing me stress! _________ Our Picture Prompt “Family Cooking” brought in descriptions of familiar and unfamiliar cooking traditions. Abby Tank Wilmington, N.C., loves the old and the new traditions: My family has many cooking traditions, some new and some old. Spaghetti with homemade meat sauce, my mother’s homemade green chili, and my father’s famous dry-rub chicken are among the greats in my family’s diverse food catalog. No matter what happens earlier that day, I can always count on my parents to make a delicious, home-cooked dinner. New recipes and ideas for food are constantly being experimented with. Just the other night, my mom made an absolutely amazing soup with black-eyed peas, chicken, rice, mushrooms, and spices in it. I am very open to trying new foods. This is partly because of the rule my parents established for dinner when my siblings and I were younger: Two bites of everything. No exceptions. Full, complete bites. This rule has broadened my taste pallet and has allowed me to appreciate all types of food whether it’s escargot, alligator, calamari, sushi, or just a simple steak. Rex Hardy from Wilmington, N.C., cherishes family food traditions: My family and I don’t really know our ancestry in terms of cultural related traditions, but we have made some of our own that I’m sure will be passed down. These traditions are usually held on the holidays. On Superbowl Sunday, if that’s considered a holiday, my sister and I have a dessert cook-off. We don’t really pick who wins or losses(even though I’m the obvious winner), instead, we enjoy what we prepared as we watch the game. Another tradition we have falls on Christmas. It is called the Kong Fu Panda Pizza. I believe it got its name after my mom told us we could be like the Kong Fu Panda after eating it. It is rolled out croissant bread with eggs, cheese, and bacon bits on top. A couple days later, New Year’s Eve is being celebrated in our house and we all take pleasure in having our own, homemade Coke Floats.Lastly, there’s a tradition that has died out that I wish we would decide to continue. It would happen on Sunday after church. My family and my cousin’s family would all go to my grandma’s for a big, home-cooked lunch. We would have green beans, peas, fried chicken, barbeque, slaw, biscuits, and potatoes; finished off with a nice, cold glass of sweet tea. Later we would have some sort of pound cake with ice cream.I thoroughly enjoy the food-related traditions we have, but I wish we had more. I love food and it’s something that everybody can relate to. It also brings people together. Jacqueline Rose Behringer from Wilmington, N.C., said her family specializes in German food: My family and I have many various cooking traditions - almost all cultural related. For example - for all holidays, we cook a variety of German food - Kebassi, Spaetzel, etc. We also make Slovakian food, such as a really good recipe for Bondukis. When I personally participate in helping my parents/family make these things in the kitchen, it makes me feel like I’m really in touch with my origin/culture/heritage more. I can celebrate my German and Slovakian culture, and learn more about it, while I help cook. My parents usually tell me stories about our culture while we bake, so, it helps me to feel more informed. IN KOP PA connects family food traditions with happiness: In the summertime my dad usually grills a steak on a small fire-pit in backyard or on the barbeque grill. We top the steak off with potatoes and a some kind of salad. In the winter time my family eats Ukrainian perogies and soup. These are an everyday meal. My favorite time is summertime because I get to spend time with my family outdoors. Participating in the food rituals makes me feel happy and stress free spending time with the people I love eating what I love. Katie Gibbons from Buffalo, N.Y., credits family food choices with making her more open-minded: My parents were both raised in lower middle class households with Northern European lineages; essentially, meat and potatoes were their way of life and seasoning was a four-letter-word. They were the only ones in their families to reject this way of eating as they grew up, turning to more exotic fare. They raised me with the same appreciation for spice and variety. My mom loves to reminisce about the time that I asked for quinoa instead of chicken nuggets at a family party; the confused stares of the adults proved to my mom that she had done her job. I grew up to enjoy everything from paneer makhani to squid ink pasta. My parents’ refusal to conform to the food standards of their families ultimately made me a more open-minded individual, ready to try almost anything you put in front of me! _________ Our Picture Prompt "Statue of Liberty," asked what the statue says about America today. Most commenters connected the image to President Trump and his policies. Jessica Lee from Wilmington, N.C., says immigrants are assets to our communities and our nation: I think this political cartoon relates to President Trump’s recent comments about certain countries. Many of you may know the inappropriate things our President said, in spite of our country’s reputation of acceptance of many cultures, whether they are wealthy or not. The statue of liberty now reads: Give Me Your Norwegians. People should be able to come from anywhere, by choice. The statue of liberty casts a shadow on the flag, symbolizing our justice and laws previously instated being outshone by President Trump’s actions and executive orders that he is using to avoid the legislative process. President Trump is using his authority to push out people who are not his norm. He says it is because of terrorism, or because they are not wealthy countries, but in reality it is just people who are not like him. President Trump is shutting out the rest of the world, isolating our country. Multiple countries such as Mexico, Venezuela, Chad, and predominantly Muslim countries will not be able to send immigrants to our country by the time Trump’s presidency is over. This will have detrimental effects on our country and our economy as a whole. Immigrants do not steal our jobs, they only take the jobs that rich white men would never want. Immigrants are assets to our community and bring diversity to our “free” nation. Tara Samtmann from Wilmington, N.C., isn’t hopeful on reaching a consensus: The cartoonist is using the comment on the Statue of Liberty to send the message that President Trump’s recent comments and his policy on immigration does not support the foundations on which this country was built. The cartoonist is implying that America only wants to have white, law abiding immigrants come to our country. This is the complete opposite position the US had in late 1800’s/early 1900’s when immigrants from all over the world were coming to the US for a better and brighter future. But the other implied message is that the US has a big immigration problem, which needs to be handled very carefully. Unfortunately, I do not think that the US will ever be able to have an immigration policy which everyone will be able support. I also feel that President Trump should really think before he speaks or Tweets, because it is very easy for his comments to be misinterpreted or not be taken seriously. Skaina Pierre from Danvers, Mass., quoted Emma Lazarus: The original inscription on the Statue of Liberty is well know for the phrase, “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”. Donald Trump’ s most recent statement on immigration and his concerns go against the very basis of what America is supposed to represent. This political cartoon In is entirety visually illustrates how demeaning it is to make generalizations towards a certain group of people. The Statue of Liberty is supposed to symbolize freedom and hope for those who are in countries where the basic human right is unattainable. _________ Commenters unanimously answered in the affirmative for our Student Opinion question “Do Companies Have a Responsibility to Contribute Positively to Society?”  Leah Schwagerl from Wilmington, N.C., said C.E.O.s should work in unison with other employees: I feel that BlackRocks push for holding companies accountable is not only going to benefit the popularity of the company but it will also spread a wave of initiative among companies to be aware of their outreach on society. Companies should absolutely have the responsibility to contribute positively to society. A third party overseer might be the key to initially starting the movement of social awareness, however, the tight knit relationships formed in companies between employees, consumers, executives, and CEO’s should work in unison to ensure the positive contributions. Companies can have a social purpose. For example, CVS took the responsibility to stop selling tobacco products in 2014, last year they announced that they would remove certain chemicals from 600 beauty products by the end of 2019, and just recently they stated that they will “stop significant touch-ups of images”. Josh Failla of Wilmington, N.C., thinks about the topic often: Every weekend when my mom goes to shop at Whole foods, I think about all the good that they have done in the community. They created the Local Producer Loan program that provides millions of dollars in loans to local producers. They promote nonrenewable resources and encourage the cleaning of the Earth. They also fight poverty all over the world, and I want to shop at a place that cares as much about their profits as they do for the world. The move that Mr. Fink is making is one that is very needed. If major companies are not going to change their ways for being only profit motive, then someone with enough power like BlackRock need to force them to do so. As a major investor, if you want something down about a business, then you should be able to change how a business is run. If the executives don’t agree with you, then you can just stop investing in the operations. With all the profits that these businesses are making, then they should want to give back to the community even without outside pressure. This movement may change big businesses for the good and it will be beneficial to everyone. Meghan Miraglia from Massachusetts said business needs to evolve: The world, and its consumer market, is changing rapidly. America, I think, was once a child - a toddler with a spoon clenched in its chubby fist, squash and peas dribbling down its bib, screaming for more, more. Now, I think that consumers are more like the slightly more socially conscious ten-year-old - we have deviated, or are attempting to deviate, from the “give me this, give me that” norm and asking companies and businesses the Big Questions. “Where does this product come from?”, “Is this brand cruelty-free?”, “Does this company/manufacturer use sweatshops?”, and “How does this company/business give back on a community scale as well as on a global scale?” are just a few questions I have seen pop up beneath ads on my social media feed. Even if a company isn’t directly interacting with the public (through selling its products/goods/services, etc), it makes sense to give back and get more involved. People like that kind of thing - they like to see that if they cannot directly help society, at the very least, they are giving money to a company or business that does. However, as the world shifts from a place where all we do is take, to a place where we (at least give the illusion that we) are giving back, it only makes sense that companies and businesses evolve alongside us. Hee Yun Chung from California cited companies that have made a difference: I think in the past, companies didn’t really have to contribute to society since their employees could be paid a good wage to buy homes and promote economic growth. In the modern economic landscape, it is becoming imperative for companies to contribute to society. After the 2008 Great Recession, people all over the country are still struggling to make ends meet. As a result of the recession and a rapidly changing economy, income inequality worsened. Companies became richer while public disdain for large companies grew. To give credit where credit is due, many companies have taken their own steps to help society in a positive way. Some companies increased their wages and have invested in communities. One example would be Aetna, the healthcare company. The CEO of Aetna, Mark Bertolini figured out that his own employees were financially struggling and relied on government subsidies. He took action by increasing the company’s wage to $16, help pay college debts, and promised to not pass downs the costs on the consumer. Bertolini has said that corporate leaders should step up and create “a new capitalism” by taking the time to understand their workers. Companies don’t have a lot to lose in the current economic climate. When 18% of the American people believe that corporations are good, a serious conversation has to occur between corporate owners, workers, and communities in order for society to improve as the economy changes over the years. Bella Cankurtaran from Wilmington, N.C., has made personal changes in shopping choices: When it comes to shopping I am very picky on who I choose to buy from. Why would I want I want to sponsor a brand who only thinks about themselves? When companies give back to the community, I know they are making the product out of the kindness of their hearts rather than for money. Plus, it’s a win win when you order a product you love and donate to a charity all in one purchase. For example, I used to love Steve Madden shoes until I realized they had no ‘Our Story’ page on their website for what charities they donated to. It infuriated me that the company of the shoes I wore almost everyday in middle school choose to keep their profits and not think about the countless starving, homeless, and shoeless people around the globe. Here they are selling shoes when millions of impoverished people walk miles around barefoot. That’s why I switched to Toms brand. Not only do they give a pair of shoes to a person who needs it, but the company also provides eye treatment, water, safe birth, and bullying response programs. I feel more than confident strutting around in appealing yet comfortable shoes that help other people who aren’t as fortunate as me. Anna Cross from Wilmington, N.C., quoted an American economist:  Milton Friedman said “What does it mean to say that ‘business’ has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities”, but as a business is created solely for and by people, this statement seems a bit contradictory. Businesses have everything to do with people. People create businesses, work for businesses, purchase goods and services from businesses; all it is is a collection of individuals attempting to make a profit. As the influence and reputation of a business grows, their responsibilities grow as well, for they gain the ability to positively or negatively affect more people. Unfortunately in my city, one business decided their influence should be negative. It was recently made public where I live that a chemical manufacturer had been dumping unregulated chemicals into our source of drinking water for years, most notably a substance called “Gen X”, which potentially causes cancer. For some reason, this doesn’t feel right to me. A business, as it is made by humans, should have responsibilities to other humans, if not in the advancement of society, than the preservation of it. For a business to take a risk (ex: dumping mystery chemicals in the river) that may harm a community of people for financial gain is unethical and immoral of every single person who runs it. We need businesses that respects their workers and customers and improves society, rather than be a detriment to it. Francesca Altunyay from Wilmington, N.C., wants companies to be held accountable: The extent to which corporate greed goes in America has shown itself for decades. From oil companies not holding themselves accountable for pollution and climate change to multi-billion dollar business representatives refusing to even breathe near political opinions for the sake of remaining neutral, it has made itself apparent that corporations value practices that “make short term sense” but eventually threaten their “long term viability,” as said by Jana in the article. Whether they like it or not, businesses do have societal responsibilities as long as they involve themselves, interact with, and produce things for society. Businesses are not just huge faceless, unidentifiable, artificial entities - they are created by people, run by people, and comprised of working people. They should be held accountable for all products they manufacture and ensure that they are not detrimental to any groups of people in particular or any people in general. BlackRock’s action to push Exxon into releasing climate impact reports was a smart move, and now says to the public, “We know that we’re actively affecting the Earth in a negative way!”, which gives them liability for any damage they inflict. I think all companies should be honest about whatever it is they provide for society; I’ve boycotted products and businesses for child/slave labor, or if their investors or presidents have openly supported prejudiced organisations against my personal beliefs. My life is better for it. Logan Bolduc from Wilmington, N.C., wrote about the key role that shoppers play: I think it is our duty as shoppers to chose what companies are good for our community. Should we shop at a store who employs local people and recycles or should we shop at a store who has their materials shipped in from a sweatshop and charges four times the price it costs to make their clothing. All in all, the customer is the one who decides weather a business stays open, does the customer want good or do they want cheap? _________ Our Picture Prompt "Phone Warnings" asked if phones should carry addition warnings. Comments ran the gamut from a strong “no” to an emphatic “yes.” Gabriel Sachs from Israel wrote about the profound impact our phones now have on us: What do you do when there’s nothing to do? You take out your phone. What do you do when there’s something to do? You take out your phone. Replace ‘phone’ with ‘cigarette’, and we’re back in the 50s. Unlike cigarettes, though, phones don’t have addiction warnings. Like cigarettes, they should. In German, there’s one word for both ‘addiction’ and ‘dependence’. When we’re addicted to something, it’s synonymous to being dependent on it. Instead of asking yourself if you’re addicted, ask the following: “Do I take out my phone when I’m in public transportation to compensate for my inability to remedy my loneliness by talking to another human being?” If the answer is yes, you’re dependent, ergo, addicted. “Do I take out my phone the moment I feel a small pinch of boredom rushing into the air?” Yes? Addicted. Dependent. Obsessed. Possessed. You name it. A recent study — https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/06/170623133039.htm — found that taking a test in MERE PROXIMITY of a phone negatively affects results. If your dependent at any degree, the simple fact that you’re physically close to your phone disrupts your performance in whatever task at hand. Now, think how many people drive with their phones on their dashboard. Forget texting while driving, try phoning while driving. Even if you blatantly oppose everything I’ve written until now, I think we can agree a week without your phone would be pretty hard. If you were smoking, you’d go to rehab. Phones need addiction labels. Maggie Yang of King of Prussia thinks the individual bears responsibility: Phone companies should not be forced to make addiction warnings for their phones. It is completely up to the individual to maintain self-control. I think of it as like eating junk food. You need to stay in control of yourself and avoid eating too much unhealthy foods. Fast food companies don’t go out of their way to say that their foods can lead to heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, etc. It is up to us to make that choice for ourselves. Kaley Nesselroade from Wilmington, N.C., agrees: I think phones should not come with addiction warnings. Tech companies should not be held responsible for their users becoming addicted to their product. It is completely up to individuals to use their phones responsibly. I feel like even if phones were to add addiction warnings, the overall outcome wouldn’t change. Yes, there are some things that could be done to help phone users become more aware of their usage, like phones giving a report on how you spent your time, but in the end it just doesn’t seem necessary. People know how much they are using their phones and seeing a warning for how much it is will not change their usage. It is up to the individual to tell if the amount of time spent on their phone is healthy or not. Ishan Patel of Wilmington, N.C., came up with this creative solution: It is not their fault that people get addicted to their created device, the tech companies goal is just to create a new innovative device that the users find to suit their needs. People use their phone in a different way their no universal balance how we use our phone everybody has a different balance, people use their phone focusing on few things or using almost all the features. Now if the user overuses the device and becomes addicted to it then that would be on the user not on the company. The most I would expect from tech companies would be an in build software that has cooldown time when you use social media software and games for a long time so that way you can still use your phone for work but not for going on social media and playing games and to be honest this argument is not even worth discussing because it’s like buying Netflix and telling them to lower the number of movies and shows available so people don’t get addicted to it and slack off on their work. Mitchell Boehling from Wilmington, N.C.,  thinks Apple should do all it can to decrease phone addiction: With the addition of smartphones, Smart speakers(Alexa and Google Home), and with increasing amount of advertisements it seems that we never are just by ourselves anymore, were always connected. The threat of manipulation that technology poses is incredible because the way it is all connected can be quite addictive for some. If Apple has the ability to decrease this dangerous amount of addiction especially when concerning children then I believe that they should do so in anyway that they can. Because technology will only continue to grow more and more addictive. _________ We’re interested in your feedback on this page. Tell us what you think. See More » Go to Home Page »
