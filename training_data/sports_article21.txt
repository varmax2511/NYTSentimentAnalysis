Advertisement                  Weekend Miser             By                      A. C. LEE  JAN. 2, 2014  By its very nature, the vocation of the Weekend Miser entails a certain myopia, a laserlike focus on discrete three-day periods. To kick off the new year, let’s switch things up, shall we, with a more seasonal view of free or nearly free things to do in New York City: a Winter Miser, if you will. A Guitar-Led Quintet Jump right in this weekend at BAMcafé, where the Mary Halvorson Quintet takes the bandstand on Saturday night. One of the city’s most acclaimed young guitar players, Ms. Halvorson will lead a band made up of her regular rhythm section — the bassist John Hébert and the drummer Ches Smith — along with the trumpeter Jonathan Finlayson and the saxophonist Jon Irabagon. Admission is free; get there early for happy hour, from 6 to 8 p.m. (Saturday at 9 p.m.; 30 Lafayette Avenue at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn; 718-636-4100; bam.org.) Short Films, Israeli Style The Film Society of Lincoln Center will present the 23rd annual New York Jewish Film Festival in the middle of the month, and while there are many worthy gems at less-than-multiplex prices, the Miser would point you to the free screening of “New Israeli Shorts,” four summer-themed films from 2012 in Hebrew with English subtitles, on Jan. 18, at the Film Center’s intimate indoor Amphitheater. Tickets will be distributed first come first served, starting one hour before the 6:30 p.m. showtime. (Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, 144 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; 212-875-5367; filmlinc.com.) City Dreams and Dr. King Advertisement As New York turns a page politically with a new team in City Hall, WNYC will celebrate the birthday of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at 3 p.m. on Jan. 19 at the Apollo Theater with “Dreams for NYC Inspired by MLK,” a panel discussion focused on the city’s future, moderated by Brian Lehrer and with a live performance by Vernon Reid. Admission is free, but reservations, via the Apollo website, are required. Advertisement (253 West 125th Street, at Frederick Douglass Boulevard; apollotheater.org, wnyc.org.) Pictures of War Onstage The stark photography of Eugene Richards comes chillingly alive at the Brooklyn Museum on Jan. 25, when Mr. Richards directs actors in a dramatic presentation of several stories told in his recent book of photo essays, “War Is Personal.” The event, presented in conjunction with the exhibition “War/Photography: Images of Armed Conflict and Its Aftermath,” starts at 2 p.m. and is included with museum admission, a suggested $12 for adults and $8 for students with ID and adults 62 and older. (200 Eastern Parkway, at Washington Avenue, Prospect Heights; 718-638-5000; brooklynmuseum.org.) Year of the Horse Many New Yorkers will gravitate toward Chinatown for the Lunar New Year, when a parade and festival starting at 1 p.m. on Feb. 2 will ring in the Year of the Horse. On the weekends before and after, the New York Chinese Cultural Center, for the 27th consecutive year, will take the party to cultural institutions across the city, with a program focusing on traditional dance and offering craft workshops for all ages. The event is included with museum admissions, except at Snug Harbor in Staten Island, where admission is $10. (Jan. 25, at 2 p.m., Bronx Museum, 1040 Grand Concourse, at East 165th Street, 718-681-6000, bronxmuseum.org; Jan. 26, at 1 p.m., Queens Museum, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org; Feb. 8, at 1 p.m., Metropolitan Museum of Art, 212-535-7710, metmuseum.org; Feb. 9, at 2 p.m., Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, 718-448-2500, snug-harbor.org.) A Super Bowl Festival This year the New York area plays host to Super Bowl XLVIII, which will take place across the Hudson River at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, N.J. With the cheapest seats still going for well into the hundreds of dollars, the Miser’s attendance is doubtful, but you might catch him on Super Bowl Boulevard, a free N.F.L.-sponsored street festival in Times Square that runs from Jan. 29 to Feb. 1 and will include autograph sessions, live performances and a toboggan run. (Noon to 10 p.m.; Broadway from 34th Street to 47th Street; nfl.com/superbowl.) Watching the Seals Of course grinding it out on the gridiron, despite its popularity, isn’t everyone’s idea of a sporting life and far from the only reason to be outdoors this time of year. The Urban Park Rangers offer programs throughout the winter, but the Miser has an eye on their seal-watching expedition, at Orchard Beach Nature Center at Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx on Feb. 8 at 10 a.m. The tour is free; binoculars are recommended.

Sort of a postmodern medieval minstrel, Mr. Schumann delivers the “news” to his own musical accompaniment. In keeping with tradition, the audience will be served bread freshly baked by Mr. Schumann on the premises. Performance and snack are included with museum admission, and presented in conjunction with “Peter Schumann: The Shatterer,” a retrospective of his work.

(Jan. 11, Feb. 15 and March 15, 4 p.m.; Queens Museum, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, 718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org.) Coney Island Conjurers Anyone with an unseasonal hankering to hit the beach during these colder months should consider a ride out to Coney Island on Sunday afternoons, where at 2 p.m. the outfit responsible for the inimitable Mermaid Parade presents the “Magic at Coney!” series, a vintage magic and variety show featuring a phalanx of conjurers, hypnotists and escape artists, among others. It plays weekly at Sideshows by the Seashore through April 13. Admission is $12; $8 for children under 12. (1208 Surf Avenue, at West 12th Street, Coney Island, Brooklyn; coneyisland.com.) A report in the Weekend Miser column on Jan. 3 about “fiddle sermons” gave an outdated name for the museum where they are being presented by Peter Schumann. It is now the Queens Museum, no longer the Queens Museum of Art. A version of this article appears in print on January 3, 2014, on Page C26 of the New York edition with the headline: A Season’s Worth of Cheap Thrills.
