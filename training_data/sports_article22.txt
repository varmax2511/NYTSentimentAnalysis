Seattle outmatched Denver from the beginning of the game to the end, crushing Peyton Manning and the Broncos offense. Times reporters, editors and photographers offered updates all day and throughout the game on everything from the weather to the commercials, from the traffic to the halftime show. They even mixed in some football analysis.    11:01 P.M.Another Season Comes to a Close    Photo  The Seahawks celebrated their Super Bowl victory in the locker room.Credit John Branch/The New York Times   Even the most ardent fans of the Seattle Seahawks were likely not predicting Super Bowl XLVIII to be so lopsided. From the flubbed snap on the game’s first play right up through the fourth quarter, Seattle outplayed the Denver Broncos in every way. A week that was dominated with talk of Peyton Manning’s legacy ended up with one of the most embarrassing losses in Super Bowl history, and Manning was largely responsible for his team’s struggles. This Super Bowl proved a number of things: Experience can sometimes be less important than talent; a great defense and a good offense beat a great offense and a mediocre defense; and just because you call something “the first cold-weather Super Bowl” does not mean it will actually be cold. MetLife Stadium proved to be a good site for the actual game, with the main issues centering on the inability to provide adequate public transportation for the 80,000-plus fans in attendance. Whether or not there is another outdoor Super Bowl in a cold-weather city is uncertain. Commissioner Roger Goodell was noncommittal when asked about plans for more. But it would be surprising for the league not to try again after this experiment has seemingly been a huge success. As the few remaining fans (all of whom appear to be Seahawks fans) linger in the stadium’s lower seats, the N.F.L. season is officially over. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:47 P.M.Sherman Sounding Like Not-Sherman   Apparently all of Richard Sherman’s powers of braggadocio were contained in his injured ankle. His postgame comments, even if they were screamed, seem like the words of a much more humble and gracious man than the one the world met after the N.F.C. championship game. “We had a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication and the team deserves it,” Sherman said. “Russell Wilson, Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor, they deserve this. The ‘Legion of Boom,’ baby. I hope we etched our names in the history books. This is the No. 1 offense in the history of the N.F.L. and we were able to play a good game against them. Peyton Manning may go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game, and we’re just blessed to have an opportunity to play against him. I can’t believe it.” — BENJAMIN HOFFFMAN     10:44 P.M.The Seahawks Have Left the Building    Photo  Seahawks players left the field after winning the Super Bowl.Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times       10:41 P.M.Lynch Opens Up   Marshawn Lynch was noted for being tight-lipped all week. He kept that up in his press availability after the game. He answered three of the questions with a total of 12 words. But he did open up about not celebrating on the field: “Man, they know how I feel about it. This is big time. This has been a tradition since I came, since forever. It’s just what I do. Everybody knows it. They respect it.” For Lynch, that was quite a bit of talking. For his teammate Richard Sherman, that would barely be enough words to clear his throat. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:35 P.M.Harvin Discusses Kick Return   “We had bounce-right, counter-right. We were calling for it all week. We knew it was a good chance. We had to put that on film all year, and the guys did a heck of a job blocking. As soon as I caught the ball it was open field.” — Percy Harvin on his 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:20 P.M.Fourth-Quarter Ad Update    The whistle has blown, the Seahawks have won and the ad bowl within Super Bowl XLVIII is over. A quick wrap on the last quarter: 11 spots, by my count, on par with the third quarter, also 11, confirming previous patterns of networks running more spots in the first half than in the second half, as insurance against just the kind of lopsided result there was Sunday night. Many might say the ad bowl saved the best for last, or at least the most-watched and most-liked before the game for last, in that “Puppy Love” spot for Budweiser ran in the fourth quarter. It kicked off an all-nice, all-awwwwww, hap, hap, happy commercial pod; it was followed by a cheery song in a GoDaddy spot and the second of two Doritos spots that won a consumer contest, which featured a boy, a dog and a cute ending. (Question for the creator of the Doritos spot: Do kids really still play cowboys, or is that something out of “Dennis the Menace”?) Another notable ad in the fourth quarter was for SodaStream, featuring Scarlett Johansson. It had a different line from a previous version because Fox would not let the company knock Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola as it wanted to do. (The spot Fox would not run was uploaded to YouTube, a strategy that SodaStream followed last year, too, when CBS rejected a Coke/Pepsi poke in an ad.)  In an unfortunate juxtaposition, the SodaStream spot was preceded by one of three ads for T-Mobile; the third T-Mobile spot was a plain-looking thing, with only text on screen, and joked that maybe next year T-Mobile would run an ad with “overpaid movie stars.” Then came the SodaStream spot with Ms. Johansson. Oops! The 11 ads in the fourth quarter, added to 11 in the third, 17 in the second and 15 in the first, brings the Super Bowl XLVIII ad count to 54. That is about par for recent ad bowls. Looking back across the entire evening, there were some dominant themes and approaches among the spots. Patriotic appeals and celebrations of Americana were plentiful, in ads for, among others, WeatherTech, Chrysler and Coca-Cola. As noted in a previous post, the parade of stars was one of the biggest in recent Super Bowls, with the later quarters adding to the ranks Ms. Johansson, Danica Patrick, three cast members of “Full House,” three British actors known for playing bad guys, Johnny Galecki, Richard Lewis, Bob Dylan, Bruce Willis, Laurence Fishburne and Mandy Patinkin. And there was, in general, a sweeter tone to many of the ads compared to previous years when sexy sales pitches, sight gags and sarcasm predominated. To be sure, there were some brands that sought to be “daring,” like Butterfinger with the sex joke in the marriage counselor’s office. But brands like Bank of America, Beats Music, Budweiser,  Cheerios, Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, Doritos, GoDaddy, Honda, Microsoft and Toyota took a higher road. Be sure to come back here on Monday, and check the print edition of The New York Times, for another look back at all the ads of Super Bowl XLVIII. — STUART ELLIOTT     10:17 P.M.Fans Asked to Stay in Place   An announcement was just made in MetLife Stadium that anyone hoping to use public transportation should remain inside the stadium until given further instruction. Congestion is apparently so bad that the platforms cannot handle the waiting passengers. As the night starts to get colder, the success of the first cold-weather outdoor Super Bowl could be tarnished if fans are expected to stand around for too long. The line for the train at MetLife is really long. #Super Bowl //t.co/Q2A1IMLzdc — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 3 Feb 14  — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:16 P.M.Smith Gets M.V.P.    Photo  Seahawks linebacker Malcolm Smith was named the most valuable player of the Super Bowl.Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times   Malcolm Smith was named the Super Bowl most valuable player. The award had gone to an offensive player in 40 of the previous 47 Super Bowls, but Smith’s interception and fumble recovery were crucial to the Seattle win. All week the team’s secondary, known as the Legion of Boom, got the attention, but it was Smith who intercepted a pass to clinch the N.F.C. championship, and once again he came up huge for his team. The third-year player was the 242nd pick in the 2011 draft. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:12 P.M.Unused Confetti   There is blue and green confetti everywhere, with plenty of it still floating in the air. My colleague Steve Eder points out “there are cannons full of orange and blue confetti somewhere sitting unused, right?” It makes you wonder if that confetti is then sent to lesser events, similar to the way the “Denver Broncos Super Bowll XLVIII Champions” t-shirts will all be sent to developing countries. What happens to all the unused orange and blue confetti? #SuperBowl //t.co/ZSnDKJ3pRM — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 3 Feb 14  — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:07 P.M.The Traditional Handshake   Chang W. Lee/The New York Times John Fox and Pete Carroll after the game.     10:05 P.M.Putting Things Into Perspective   The concourse outside the open-air press box became a sea of orange as Denver Broncos fans fled. One man in an orange Broncos jacket and cap, who said his name was Mike, had three words for what had happened in the stadium. “Epic failure,” he said. “Disappointing.” “It’s just football, though, you know what I mean?” he said. “There’s more important stuff in life than football games.” And no, he would not say what his last name was. “I’m a family member of a player,” he said. — JAMES BARRON     10:01 P.M.Puppy Finds a Best Bud    I feel like that Budweiser commercial made me want to buy a puppy more than buy Budweiser… — Jacob Giesler (@JacobGiesler) 3 Feb 14  The most anticipated commercial of the Super Bowl — and that’s because Budweiser floated this ad out early last week, and it stars a puppy — finally ran during the two-minute warning. Obviously, Budweiser was hoping its heartstring-pulling puppy/Clydesdale love story would get the most attention this late in the game. And that strategy backfired with a dreadful blowout that has put fans in a coma.  That said, you can’t not love this commercial. Hate Bud. Hate commercialism. Hate bad Super Bowls. But you have to love the puppy.   — LYNN ZINSER     10:03 P.M.Seahawks Are Just Beginning   As the confetti was fired from cannons and fell back down onto the players’ heads, Van Halen played because a more recent song would just be far too scary. But for Seattle, a brand-new team with a young roster, this could be the first celebration of many, and a fresh song would have felt more appropriate.  Seattle won this game by sticking to the team’s principles and exploiting the weaknesses of a team that until now did not seem to have any flaws. It was a perfect example of playing together to reach a team goal. While some fans left early, undoubtedly trying to avoid the transportation nightmare they experienced getting here, most of the fans made it through a noncompetitive game that at some point started to feel like a commercial for just how good the Seahawks are.  Every Super Bowl team has its share of players who suddenly believe they should be paid far more money and leave the team for greener pastures, but this team is filled with lower-round draft picks in their first few seasons, so they should have at least a few more years together to continue to dominate the N.F.L. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     10:01 P.M.Giving Thanks   Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Seahawk players prayed after winning the Super Bowl.     9:59 P.M.FINAL: Seattle 43, Denver 8   That’s it. A shockingly lopsided Super Bowl ends with a shockingly lopsided score. The Seahawks win their first title, and Peyton Manning is the bridesmaid again.  The real star of the game was the Seattle defense, which produced a safety on the game’s first play and never let up. The Broncos didn’t pick up a first down until the second quarter, but lost four turnovers and looked out of sorts all night.  Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson passed for 208 and 2 touchdowns (both the Jermaine Kearse) for Seattle, but more important avoided the mistakes that haunted Denver all night. In addition to Manning’s two interceptions, the Broncos had four fumbles, losing two of them. Manning finished with 34 completions (a Super Bowl record) and 280 yards, but he also threw two interceptions, including a crusher that Malcolm Smith returned for a touchdown in the second quarter.  Adding to his forgettable night: this crushing defeat was Manning’s 12th postseason loss, the most in N.F.L. history.  — ANDREW DAS     9:53 P.M.Two Minutes Left   Not surprisingly, Tarvaris Jackson (!) couldn’t lead the Seahawks into the end zone. So Manning will get a couple more plays here and we wind it down. Pete Carroll, meanwhile, will join Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer in adding a Super Bowl ring to an N.C.A.A. football championship. Well done. His team was unstoppable today. — ANDREW DAS     9:53 P.M.Not Much Happening Here    Photo  Peyton Manning and the Broncos offense stood around for most of the game.Credit Chang W.

On fourth down he drops back and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by Chris Clemons as he throws. FUMBLE!!! And of course Seattle recovers it at the Denver 29. There’s 3:44 left and Seattle can rub their noses in it if they want. — ANDREW DAS     9:46 P.M.Richard Sherman Is in a Good Mood    Photo  Credit Bob Eckstein   — BOB ECKSTEIN     9:46 P.M.And Then There Were 13   With the Seahawks about to win a Super Bowl for the first time, the list of teams that have never won it all has shrunk to 13. The Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Philadelphia Eagles, San Diego Chargers, Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans, Carolina Panthers and Arizona Cardinals all came up empty in their Super Bowl appearances. The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars have never even had the chance to lose. The Browns and Lions at least had a life before the Super Bowl, each winning N.F.L. championships before the creation of the league’s signature event.  Seattle will now have championships in football and basketball (Seattle Supersonics in 1978-79). The rabid sports fans of their city can now focus their attention on getting the Mariners and Sounders to join the city’s champions club. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     9:43 P.M.These Broncos Fans Are Unhappy, but Warm   They are disconsolate, the Denver Broncos fans who have tickets that let them retreat to the huge, heated Lexus Club at MetLife Stadium. “I can’t stand to be outside waiting for my team to show up,” said Jim Grunditsch of Vail, Colo. “I can take three steps and get a painkiller, or stay outside, where Seattle fans will wave towels in my ear. What would you do?” Jamie Darvish, wearing a Washington Redskins jersey, said he too was rooting for Denver. He said he had paid $6,000 for a ticket with a face value of $2,500, but he had his reasons for leaving his seat and going inside. “It’s all Seattle fans where we are,” he said, “so I will stay in here. If you had to pick two teams that have the most-chilled fans, it would be these two. ‘Oh, that was tough. Sorry you missed that touchdown.’ But still.” — JAMES BARRON     9:40 P.M.Third-Quarter Ad Update        Three quarters down, one to go, and already there is mumbling online about the lopsided score and whether advertisers in the second half of the game will regret their ad buys. That is why there historically have been more ads in the first half of a Super Bowl than in a second. Also, the last few games were close until the final whistle, so buying later in the game is not on its face a foolish idea.           In any event, there were by my count 11 national spots in the third quarter, including a biggie from Chrysler for the new Chrysler 200 with a new theme, “America’s import,” echoing “Imported from Detroit” with Eminem from a previous big game.           This time, Bob Dylan replaced Eminem and delivered a paean to American manufacturing and Detroit that was the second such spot in the game, after WeatherTech in the second quarter.            And who would have bet that two commercials in a 2014 Super Bowl would feature Mr. Dylan, much less two in the same quarter? A Chobani ad in the quarter used his song “I Want You.”            (Chobani brought another bear, too, after CarMax and Beats Music. Poor Stephen Colbert, he hates them!)          There were many kinder, gentler ads in the third quarter, among them the GoldieBlox girl power salute, sponsored by Intuit; Axe Peace’s paean to love; the Heinz ketchup salute to “happy”; Audi’s pitch for adopting rescue dogs; and a surprise Honda spot with Bruce Willis urging “hugs” as a proxy for auto safety.          Forty-three commercials down, by my count, let’s see what the fourth quarter brings. — STUART ELLIOTT     9:36 P.M.The Seahawks Keep Pouring It On    Photo  Doug Baldwin scored a touchdown in the fourth quarter.Credit Chang W. Lee/The New York Times       9:35 P.M.Thomas Delivered, His Team Did Not   Demaryius Thomas has 13 catches and was just targeted by Peyton Manning for the 17th time. He already holds the Super Bowl record for receptions, many of them coming against Richard Sherman, and has been the only thing working for Denver. He may not come away with a Super Bowl ring, but he has had a memorable performance. Unfortunately for the Broncos, he has been the only thing working on offense all game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     9:35 P.M.Records? You Talking About Records?   Manning has 33 completions and Demaryius Thomas has 13 catches. Both are Super Bowl records. And nobody will care. The Broncos turn the ball over on downs. Just under 10 minutes left, and if this was a college game the walk-ons would be a getting a run. — ANDREW DAS     9:32 P.M.Sherman Leaving on a Cart   He was helped off a few plays ago, limped behind the bench and now is riding to the locker room on a cart.  And you know what? He doesn’t have to say anything today. As Muhammad Ali famously noted, it ain’t bragging if you can back it up. — ANDREW DAS     9:30 P.M.Remember the Orange Crush Years?   By my count, after tonight five Super Bowls will have been decided by 30 points or more. The Broncos will have been on the losing end of three of them. UPDATE: Yup, just checked. That’s right: Super Bowls XXII (vs. Redskins), XXIV (vs. 49ers) and XLVIII. — ANDREW DAS     9:27 P.M.Enough Is Enough for Broncos Fans   Those Denver fans had traveled so far, paid so much and come with such hope. And with a quarterback like Peyton Manning, some could still believe — even down by 36-8 in the third quarter.  But the truth is, Broncos fans have started heading for the exits at MetLife Stadium. More than one fan wearing a Manning No. 18 has been spotted inching toward the door. And it might be their best play of the night, especially for those relying on public transportation on the reverse commute. A bottleneck at Secaucus, N.J., made for a long, tough, journey to the game for some.  While Seattle’s big lead has made for a less competitive game, it might take some pressure off the transit system as the night wears on.

One way to do it: Get Bob Dylan to remind you of your patriotic duty to buy American cars. Chrysler rolls out the ’60s icon to tell you it’s O.K. to buy Asian-built cellphones or drink German beer, but “We will build your car.” You have to get over the idea that Dylan is now selling cars in 2014 — and we know not all of you will be able to — but if you can, it’s pretty effective.  — LYNN ZINSER     9:17 P.M.Good News, Denver Fans   Rockies pitchers and catchers report in 13 days. — ANDREW DAS     9:15 P.M.Patrick Stewart Is the 12th Man    //t.co/tREOdio498 — Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) 3 Feb 14      9:08 P.M.Bruce Willis Hawks Hugs    No Bruce Willis are you even watching it — Jason Kirk (@JasonKirkSBN) 3 Feb 14  The dreary competitive tone of the game apparently called for a bit of heartwarming stagecraft from Madison Avenue. So, in comes Bruce Willis — not usually Mr. Heartwarming — to tell us to hug all our friends. Somehow this was a Honda ad. Too bad he started by saying, “Great game, huh?” Um, no. Budweiser came next with a hero’s welcome for a solder coming home to Winter Park, Fla. Was probably a bit over the top, but hey, who’s going to criticize for being to sentimental about soldiers?

Here come the Broncos baby!! Well, not really. But Manning finds Demaryius Thomas from 14 yards (really nice catch under pressure, by the way) to spoil the shutout. (That catch was his 12th, a Super Bowl record, and pushed him over 100 yards for the game. So, um, yay for Thomas.) The Broncos go for 2, and Manning hits Welker out of the backfield for the conversion. Seahawks 36, Broncos 8. They’re just spoiling betting pools now. — ANDREW DAS     9:12 P.M.Broncos Off the Hook   With that touchdown, the Broncos are off the hook. They will not be the first Super Bowl team to be shut out.

In Super Bowl VI the Miami Dolphins scored just 3 points with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans.  Despite the Broncos currently losing 36-0 and having possibly the worst ever performance in a Super Bowl, their fans have stayed remarkably resilient. There are few empty seats, and the color orange is prominent throughout MetLife Stadium. While some have headed for the exits, the others have just stayed standing in their seats in stunned silence as their team’s rocket-fueled offense has looked absolutely pedestrian. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     9:07 P.M.Where Did It Go Wrong?

The Super Bowl most valuable player has been a defensive player seven times (in Super Bowl XII, two Cowboys defenders shared the award), and there is a strong likelihood that Malcolm Smith will make it eight. His pick-6 was completely demoralizing for the Broncos, and his fumble recovery certainly seems to have wrapped things up as Denver was moving the ball a little and suddenly was once again without the ball. The last defensive player to win was Dexter Jackson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. It’s only too bad for Smith that Al Davis is no longer with us.

Ouch. — ANDREW DAS     8:32 P.M.Tate Predicted Harvin Touchdown (Kinda)   Here’s what Golden Tate had to say about the return of Percy Harvin when meeting with reporters this week: “I’m excited to see him. I’m especially excited to see him back there on kickoff return. If you kick the ball to us, you never know what’s going to happen with him.” An 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown says Tate knows what he’s talking about. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     8:31 P.M.Halftime Musings    Photo  Credit Bob Eckstein   — BOB ECKSTEIN     8:30 P.M.No Pass Rush, No Problem   The scary thing about how well the Seahawks’ defense played in the first half is that it did so without sacking Peyton Manning even once. They have limited Manning to a passer rating of 46.3 with none of the Broncos’ famous receivers managing even 10 yards a reception. The Legion of Boom got most of the credit for Seattle’s defensive efficiency this season, but the team’s front seven did have the eighth-most sacks in the N.F.L. If Cliff Avril and Company can get to Manning in the second half, this could get even uglier than it already is. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     8:29 P.M.Renée Fleming’s Operatic Opening   Before the second half starts, take a moment to enjoy this review of Renée Fleming on the ArtsBeat blog. With Renée Fleming, Super Bowl XLVIII Gets an Operatic Opening Renée Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the national anthem at the Super Bowl on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., but the word “opera” went unmentioned in her introduction.     8:22 P.M.In Case You Were Wondering …   New Jersey’s Bruce Springsteen performed at the halftime show in 2009, the year before his home state was awarded this year’s game. Guessing he still would have done it if asked. — ANDREW DAS     8:18 P.M.Second-Quarter Ad Update    The second quarter is done, meaning the first half of the ad bowl inside Super Bowl XLVIII is done, too.       By my count, there were 16 commercials nationally in the second quarter, plus the Pepsi spot that ran a moment ago to promote Pepsi’s sponsorship of the halftime show.       Three of the spots in the quarter were from advertisers that did not previously raise their hands to say they were buying time on the game: Geico, Sonos and Subway. The Geico and Subway spots were not new; not sure about the Sonos spot. Spots not made for the Super Bowl, or making their debut on the game, are usually less liked than all-new ones, and sure enough, there have been several complaints on Twitter already about the Geico and Subway spots.        Other highlights included the following:       * The first of two spots for Coca-Cola was shown, with a very definitive message about diversity and inclusion, coming as Coca-Cola is facing protests from activists unhappy that the company, which is also sponsoring the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, has not come out against the Russian treatment of gays. In a news release, Coca-Cola said that it would show a longer version of the spot during the Olympics. The multicultural, multiracial cast included a vignette that by my eye was meant to be a same-sex male couple with their daughter.         * WeatherTech ran its commercial about making its products in America, a topic very much in the news.          * Some spots with sweet themes and content were shown, including the Toyota Highlander spot with the Muppets serenade, the Volkswagen spot riffing off the line from “It’s a Wonderful Life” about how angels get their wings and of course the Coke spot.          The 16 spots in the second quarter, the Pepsi spot and the 15 spots in the first quarter total 32 commercials beamed into living rooms and onto second screens nationally.          On to the second half. — STUART ELLIOTT     8:18 P.M.Mars Lives Up to His Word   Chang W. Lee/The New York Times The Red Hot Chili Peppers added a random dose of pep to the halftime show I will give Bruno Mars this: He stuck to his promise to make the performance about his songs. The stage theatrics were minimal and his band put on a good show. It seemed anticlimactic when you consider some of the megastars who preceded him, but he certainly acquitted himself well. And it was a good move by the N.F.L. to embrace a current artist, as the league has often been overly safe. Of course, midway through the show the Red Hot Chili Peppers came out to sing songs that were popular 20 years ago, so it’s still baby steps. .@BrunoMars is killing it. He’s still no @jtimberlake, but I’m with @NailaJeanMeyers on this: why not have a current, non-washed-up star? — Melissa Hoppert (@MHoppertNYT) 3 Feb 14  — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     8:17 P.M.Halftime Facts   Before you kill Bruno Mars as not “Super Bowl quality” as a halftime performer, know that Up With People did the halftime show four times, and Carol Channing did it twice. — ANDREW DAS     8:13 P.M.Bruno Mars and the Halftime Show   Chang W.

The answer, unfortunately, is yes. As a band of Muppets takes over driving a poor, unsuspecting man’s S.U.V., absolutely no hilarity ensues. In fact, it was painful to watch. Even Kermit looked pained at the end.  — LYNN ZINSER     8:00 P.M.Some Halftime Numbers   Russell Wilson: 9 of 14, 94 yards, 0 interceptions Peyton Manning: 17 of 23, 104 yards, 2 interceptions.  Anyone else identify the problem? The picks were crushing — sapping momentum and, of course, costing Denver 7 points on the Smith return. But 17 completions for only 104 yards? That’s not nearly good enough for Manning. The running games have been negligible: Percy Harvin is Seattle’s leading rusher, with two carries for 45 yards, but 30 came on one reverse. Marshawn Lynch has 17 yards on 11 carries, while Denver’s Knowshon Moreno has 5 carries for 17. — ANDREW DAS     8:02 P.M.Weather Update   They have just turned off the heat lamps in the auxiliary press box for Not-Beyoncé’s performance. This is not making me like him more. But I’m willing to be turned around by a good show. So I hope he studied the Black Eyed Peas’ performance in Dallas and plans to do nothing like that. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:57 P.M.Manning Screaming at His Line as Half Ends   Fox cut away before we could see if one of them stood up and said: “Hey, how about you stop complaining about us? And stop throwing the ball to the other team while you’re at it?” And that’s the half. Maybe the Broncos can hug it out in the locker room. — ANDREW DAS     7:58 P.M.Halftime with Not-Beyoncé   This game has been a little boring (unless you’re a Seahawks fan), and in a few minutes the halftime show is going to star Bruno Mars, whom I will refer to as Not-Beyoncé. In his news conference on Thursday, Not-Beyoncé seemed quite nice, and had very tall hair. But he failed at being Beyoncé in a way that is hard to describe. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:53 P.M.The Broncos Go for It   Manning finds Moreno at the 20, but that’s short of the first down. Denver takes a timeout, then eschews the field goal and goes for it. Bad idea. Manning, under pressure, underthrows his receiver on the left sideline. So they get nothing. — ANDREW DAS     7:51 P.M.Stephen Colbert Is Nuts    You, Stephen Colbert got robbed! Nobody should have their commercials anywhere near David Beckham in his underwear. — Page (@ACaryGrantFan) 3 Feb 14  Stephen Colbert’s debut hawking pistachios had an interesting twist. The first part of the ad was unimpressive, unless you really like birds in fluorescent green ties. But if you hung through the beefcake ad that was David Beckham for H&M, you got the payoff. It was so fitting of a Colbert bit that you would swear he wrote it. Do you think he did?   — LYNN ZINSER     7:48 P.M.Two-Minute Warning   Manning has quietly, and quickly, moved the Broncos to the Seattle 27, or what’s also known as field-goal range. At this point, given the way the half has gone, they’ll take anything that gets that goose egg off the scoreboard. — ANDREW DAS     7:49 P.M.Manning’s Legacy Secure   Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Peyton Manning has struggled in the first half.  Unless things change rapidly, there will be plenty of jokes at Peyton Manning’s expense after this game. Some of the jokes will be deserved, but the truly unfortunate thing is that he will undoubtedly be judged as a failure to the legacy of John Elway. That shows a selective memory by Broncos fans, as Elway won two Super Bowls, but also lost three, including a 55-10 drubbing at the hands of Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. Regardless of the final result, Manning is an all-time great. If he were to come back and win a Super Bowl before retiring, his losses would be forgotten, just as they were for Elway. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:45 P.M.Holliday Down by Contact   Denver keeps the ball. — ANDREW DAS     7:42 P.M.Holliday Fumbles the Kickoff!   The officials give the ball to the Seahawks, but a replay sure makes it look as if he was down before the ball was out. There will be a review of the turnover. Denver needs this call. — ANDREW DAS     7:42 P.M.Good Timing   Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Malcolm Smith runs an interception back for a touchdown  Malcolm Smith, with crucial interceptions in consecutive playoff games, had two career interceptions heading into this year’s playoffs. Apparently the third-year player out of Southern California only goes for the ball when it really matters. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:34 P.M.Tebow Shows His Versatility for T-Mobile    Among recent Denver Broncos quarterbacks, the strongest performer so far tonight is Tim Tebow, in something of an upset. — Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) 3 Feb 14  When T-Mobile announced it had signed Tim Tebow for a Super Bowl ad, well, it was going to be worth watching no matter what. The ad used the irony of Tebow being out of football perfectly, asking, “What can you do with out a contract?” Part of the answer was “find and tackle Sasquatch.” Not bad. T-Mobile hopes viewers like Tebow better than N.F.L. coaches did.  — LYNN ZINSER     7:38 P.M.Momentum? Reversed, by a Pick 6   Manning is hit as he throws on third-and-long by Orlando Franklin, and the resulting duck is plucked out of the air by linebacker Malcolm Smith. And he’s gone — returning it 69 yards for a touchdown!  The only part of the play Smith bungled was his spike over the crossbar; after running more than 70 yards, he got only about nine feet high. Oh well, they don’t take points off the board for style. Seattle 22, Denver 0.  And the momentum that had been slowly shifting swings closed like a garden gate. Wow. — ANDREW DAS     7:40 P.M.First Quarter Ad Roundup     And the first quarter of the ad bowl inside the Super Bowl is complete. Three quarters to go, assuming there is no overtime.      There were by my count 15 national commercials in the quarter, including two from the Bud Light #UpforWhatever campaign, much promoted before the game; two from Chevrolet, one with a charity component; one of two GoDaddy spots; another charity-themed ad, from Bank of America; the first commercial from Chrysler Group, for the new Maserati; and one of the winners of the annual Crash the Super Bowl contest sponsored by Doritos, inviting consumers to create ads.      Overall impressions so far are mixed, with a notable, if not uncommon observation: lots of celebrities. Three in the Bud Light spots, Ellen DeGeneres in the Beats Music spot, John C. Reilly supplying the narration in the TurboTax spot; John Turtorro helping a woman quit her job in the GoDaddy spot; U2 singing for Bank of America; and Jeff Bridges narrating the Hyundai Genesis spot.      Two charity ads in one quarter also seems to suggest a kinder kind of tone to the Super Bowl commercials.   — STUART ELLIOTT     7:39 P.M.Right Place, Right Time, Again   Malcolm Smith stepped right in front of a wobbling pass by Peyton Manning and took it back for a pick-six. It should be noted that it was Smith who was in such fantastic position to catch Richard Sherman’s deflection in the N.F.C. championship game that won it for Seattle. Manning’s second interception was an absolute crushing blow for Denver. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:36 P.M.Chancellor Returns, Denver Still Moving   Kam Chancellor has returned to the game, but Denver has continued to show some movement for the first time this game. Peyton Manning is looking more animated and the Denver half of the crowd is waking back up. A score here would certainly be good for helping this game avoid turning into a blowout. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:29 P.M.A First for the Broncos   With 10:30 left in the first half, Knowshon Moreno bulls over the right side for Denver’s first first down of the game. Is it the start of something? Let’s see them get another first. But don’t think for a minute that 15 points is enough against Peyton Manning. — ANDREW DAS     7:29 P.M.Chancellor Shaken Up   Kam Chancellor seemed to be O.K. when walking off the field after being shaken up on a kickoff, but if he is unable to return it is hard to quantify how bad that would be for Seattle. One of the absolute keys to Seattle’s style of play is the interaction between Chancellor and Earl Thomas. Losing either safety for an extended period would hurt Seattle more than losing Richard Sherman, as hard as that is to believe (especially for Richard Sherman). — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:27 P.M.Chancellor Hurt on Kickoff   Seattle’s Kam Chancellor, the hard-hitting defensive back, was injured making a tackle on the kickoff after the Seahawks touchdown. Always a peril when a starter plays on special teams. He’s walked off on his own. — ANDREW DAS     7:26 P.M.The Other Guy Delivers   Both Golden Tate and Doug Baldwin spent the week being asked about the return of Percy Harvin. While both remained optimistic that Harvin would be a huge help to the team, they also could be excused if they wanted some credit for helping get Seattle to the Super Bowl. One thing cited by all of the Seahawks was the presence Harvin would provide and how that would open things up for the other receivers. So far that seems to be working as Baldwin is the team’s leading receiver with 3 catches for 50 yards while Harvin’s contributions have come on running plays. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:24 P.M.A Different Perspective    Photo  Credit Bob Eckstein   — BOB ECKSTEIN     7:22 P.M.Leaning on Lynch, and Extending the Lead to 15-0   After a pass interference calls gives them a first-and-goal, Seattle shifts into Beast Mode — with Marshawn Lynch slamming into the line twice and delivering a 1-yard touchdown. The extra point makes it 15-0 three minutes into the second quarter.  You’re fooling yourself if you don’t think it feels as if it should be a lot more. — ANDREW DAS     7:20 P.M.Radio Shack Loves the ’80s    Did Radio Shack just admit they are old and outdated? — Ken Boxx (@kboxx97) 3 Feb 14  Radio Shack decided to tease the coming redesign of its stores in hilarious fashion. “The ’80s called.

So far, this one is all Seattle. There are many slightly chilly fans wearing orange who are having second thoughts about paying four figures to go to a football game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:16 P.M.End of 1st Quarter: Seattle 8, Denver 0, Manning M.I.A.   Denver is actually pretty lucky it’s still a game. If the Broncos’ defense hadn’t held Seattle to two field goals, they’d be in danger of getting blown out in the next few minutes. — ANDREW DAS     7:15 P.M.Know When to Say Omaha   Sometimes Omaha means Omaha and Hurry means Hurry. And sometimes, it seems, the offensive linemen of the Denver Broncos aren’t sure which is which. That, at least, seemed to be what happened on the first play of the Super Bowl. Quarterback Peyton Manning stepped toward his linemen to scream instructions when the ball went flying past his head. Perhaps center Manny Ramirez misunderstood the snap count or saw Manning move in anticipation of a snap. Or perhaps Manning was being Manning and tried to call a new play based on how Seattle’s defense lined up. Manning, after all, is the master of the audible who uses a complex matrix of code words to alert his teammates of new plays while simultaneously deceiving defenses. The system works particularly well when Manning plays at home because Broncos fans (and Colts fans before them) lower their voices so the Broncos can hear Manning’s calls. During a playoff game against the Chargers several weeks ago, it was so quiet that microphones near the field picked up Manning yelling “Omaha” dozens of times. But at MetLife Stadium, Manning lined up near the Seattle end zone where many Seahawks fans were sitting. Could the 12th Man have helped their team score the first 2 points of the game? — KEN BELSON     7:12 P.M.Another Three and Out for Manning?   Nope. Even worse: Manning overthrows Julius Thomas down the middle on third down and the ball lands right in the arms of Seattle’s Kam Chancellor at the Denver 37.  Ruh roh.  Richard Sherman, your thoughts?  “ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! YOU’RE GOING TO TRY TO COME OVER THE MIDDLE WITH A SORRY THROW LIKE THAT! DON’T YOU EVER THROW THAT BALL!” Thanks, Richard. Talk later? — ANDREW DAS     7:11 P.M.Going for Hits, Getting Picks   Kam Chancellor just did his best to lower the boom on Wes Welker. Luckily for Welker, Chancellor’s 6-foot-3 frame is simply too tall to get a clean hit on a 5-9 wide receiver. He shot right over him. Then Chancellor showed his versatility, picking off Manning and setting up yet another Seattle drive on offense. The Seattle secondary is easily looking as good as advertised. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:06 P.M.Another Field Goal for Seattle   Wilson finds Jermaine Kearse in the end zone, but Denver’s Nate Irving pops the ball out of his hands, so Hauschka comes on for another field goal. Seattle now leads, 8-0, in the third inning. I mean, first quarter. Denver Coach John Fox used his challenge just before the third-down play, to question whether an incompletion was actually a lateral. (He was wrong.) But the challenge almost seemed as if he was just buying his defense a minute to try to figure out what the heck is going on. To their credit, they’re keeping Manning in this game by forcing field goals. But they’ve been on the field A LOT in the early going. — ANDREW DAS     7:10 P.M.Three Scores, but a One-Possession Game    Photo  The Seahawks’ Golden Tate was tackled by the Broncos’ Nate Irving, left, and Brandon Marshall.Credit Timothy A. Clary/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images   The Seahawks have now scored three times, and yet Peyton Manning and the high-powered Broncos offense could tie the game with one touchdown and a 2-point conversion. While Denver has shown little ability to move the ball against Seattle, this game is still wide open. Considering how much Seattle has appeared to dominate on both sides of the ball, that’s truly remarkable.. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:04 P.M.Turbo Tax Connects Prom to Taxes    Well, Turbo Tax. Good commercial until it turned out to be for Turbo Tax. — Steve Hofstetter (@SteveHofstetter) 2 Feb 14  Turbo Tax has turned up its ad game for this tax season, with some nice, unusual ads this month, but its first Super Bowl effort really tested the edges of creativity. Since when does a high school prom-looking dance have something to do with online tax filing? Not sure I know even after watching it. But they get points for bold.  — LYNN ZINSER     7:04 P.M.Lynch Just Playing His Game   Marshawn Lynch has not done much so far (five carries for 6 yards), but Seahawks fans know a runner of Lynch’s style often takes quite a while to get going. On each play, Denver is committing multiple interior players to bringing the big running back down, and over the course of the game those big players tend to wear down. If Seattle shows a commitment to giving Lynch the ball, he’ll eventually find holes that are not opening so far. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     7:01 P.M.Wilson to Baldwin Makes It First and Goal   Make that 7 of 10 for Wilson, for 82 yards, after Doug Baldwin runs under a beautifully floated pass over Champ Bailey for a 37-yard gain. First and goal at the 6. And Denver can’t seem to do anything to stop it. — ANDREW DAS     6:59 P.M.Wilson Looking Great   Russell Wilson is 6 for 8 after a short pass to Percy Harvin, and the Broncos can’t seem to lay a glove on him. He’s had plenty of time in the pocket, but when there’s not enough, he’s gone. All the Broncos can do is chase. — ANDREW DAS     6:59 P.M.Robinson Shows Versatility   Michael Robinson, who just reeled in a 7-yard catch, is useful for many things other than serving as the temporary voice of Marshawn Lynch (as he did during the Seahawks’ media availabilities). The big fullback was a quarterback and wide receiver during his time at Penn State. He is talked about a lot less than Derrick Coleman, but Robinson is a solid football player who contributes to Seattle in a number of ways. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     6:52 P.M.Three and Out for Manning   The Broncos go nowhere — a 3-yard run, and passes of 2 and 3 yards — but look at the bright side: At least they didn’t go backward. Eli Manning pulls out his cellphone and texts Peyton’s number. “Dude, when I won my TWO Super Bowls, he’s what we did …” — ANDREW DAS     6:53 P.M.Not Impressed    So far, bud light and Doritos are tied for “worst Super Bowl commercial in 2014” — Ant (@Soulvester) 2 Feb 14      6:48 P.M.Doritos Gets a Chuckle   The latest Doritos ad is always much anticipated in the Super Bowl, and the first one wasn’t a disappointment.

Again.   Five minutes into the game, he’ll get to touch the ball for the first time — on Denver’s second play. — ANDREW DAS     6:49 P.M.It Could Be Worse for Denver   Holding the Seahawks to a field goal has to be seen as a victory for the Broncos. Off to a brutal start in which their one offensive play resulted in 2 points for the Seahawks, the Broncos now have the ball back and are less than a touchdown behind. As for the cold weather, it is official that Super Bowl VI will keep its title as the coldest Super Bowl on record. At kickoff it was a balmy 49 degrees, or 10 degrees warmer than the Broncos and the Dolphins had way back when. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     6:45 P.M.The Challenge Fails, but the Field Goal Attempt Doesn’t   Carroll was wrong, and it’ll cost him a timeout. A penalty pushes the Seahawks back as they line up to kick, but Steven Hauschka laughs at your extra 5 yards — hahaha! — and bangs the kick from 31. Seattle 5, Denver 0 with 10:21 left in the first quarter.  If you thought that 5 you drew in your Super Bowl squares was never going to happen, things may be looking up for you. — ANDREW DAS     6:45 P.M.Wilson’s Forgotten Legs   It’s really easy to forget about Russell Wilson as a runner. The Seahawks’ offense is focused so heavily on Marshawn Lynch that Wilson flies under the radar in terms of his ability to scramble and do planned runs. But that speed, which he used to set up a fourth-and-1 (Seattle challenged the play but the call on the field stood), is a weapon not only on a broken play, but also to give him time to throw. Denver’s defense is nothing special, and chasing Wilson all day will wear out their front seven. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     6:42 P.M.Seattle’s Drive Stalls   Seattle gets to Denver’s 14, but on third-and-6 Russell Wilson keeps the ball and rolls left — diving for the first-down marker. He ends up a yard short though, so Seattle will have to settle for a field goal. But hold on — Pete Carroll is challenging the spot? Replays show he’s wasting his time. — ANDREW DAS     6:40 P.M.If Only …    6,000-1 safety on first play.

The Seahawks were gifted a 2-0 lead on a bad snap (the resulting safety was the fastest score in Super Bowl history) and Percy Harvin, who had all of one catch this season, just reeled off a huge run. With the Seahawks now in the red zone, the Broncos have immediately been put on their heels, and if Seattle can score on this possession Denver will have quite a hole to climb out of. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     6:36 P.M.Seattle’s Day Improves   After the penalty forces a short kickoff, Seattle safely navigates a first down and then hands to Percy Harvin on a reverse.

As fans wearing both teams’ colors spilled into MetLife Stadium, a number were sharing tales of a “horrible” commute to the game. It was those who took trains from Manhattan through Secaucus who seemed to have gotten the worst of it. There, fans described a scene where it was hot — they guessed that it was over 95 degrees. They said they saw people fainting. Some said people were urinating as they waited in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “It was an epic fail,” said Joe Knittel, 32, of Seattle, after he spent four hours making his way to the game from Manhattan, finally arriving about an hour before kickoff. Even after making it through Secaucus, he and his friends said they waited in a long line to enter the stadium. That, too, they said was problematic, as fans lining up outside the security screening tents freely cut in front of each other as busloads of people arrived, prompting arguing and shouting. — STEVE EDER     6:25 P.M.The View From the Ballroom    Photo  Credit Bob Eckstein   — BOB ECKSTEIN     6:20 P.M.All Sherman All the Time   Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman’s postgame rant to the Fox reporter Erin Andrews after the N.F.C. championship game, shortly after he made a critical defensive play that helped the Seahawks reach Super Bowl XLVIII, instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight. On the first day of player availability, shortly after the Seahawks touched down in New York, Sherman was surrounded by television cameras and reporters, about 20 people deep. Meanwhile, the Seahawks’ young star quarterback, Russell Wilson, had about only 20 people total lingering around his podium at the Jersey City Westin. The trend continued throughout the week, especially at media day, where Sherman drew the biggest crowd of players from both teams. Wilson did not seem to mind. Asked  if he was surprised that Sherman had received so much attention in the past week, he replied: “No. I mean, he’s a great football player.” Wilson, who also played minor league baseball, continued: “All of the things that he’s done for our football team, he deserves the attention with the way that he plays. I love that about Richard.” Sherman, laughing and smiling through it all, embraced the attention but also asked for his teammates to be recognized. “I think that these cameras could be anywhere,” he said. “They could be on all my teammates, and they deserve it.” — MELISSA HOPPERT     6:17 P.M.And the Teams Are on the Field for Real   The Seahawks are introduced first, and the boos that greet them give a sense of how the crowd is leaning. The Broncos run out next — to cheers. All expect for Peyton Manning, who walks on water. I kid. The Broncos follow a white charger onto the field. Very cool. The Seahawks only had their 12th Man flag. Advantage: Broncos. — ANDREW DAS     6:17 P.M.It’s Time for Football and Some Commericals    It is almost game time for Madison Avenue as well as for the N.F.L., as marketers and agencies get ready for the annual ad bowl inside the Super Bowl.    More than 50 commercials are planned to appear during the game, from a mix of mainstay Super Bowl advertisers — among them, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, General Motors, GoDaddy, Mars, movie studios and PepsiCo — and newcomers like Beats Music, Chobani yogurt, Jaguar, Squarespace and WeatherTech.     Although most of the commercials have been available for viewing before the game, in social media like YouTube, there are some that are being kept under wraps until they appear.     For instance, Chrysler said late on Friday that it would return. The company has garnered considerable attention in recent Super Bowls for spots with content that surprised viewers like a halftime appeal by Clint Eastwood.     Come back here during the game for comments after each quarter, looking at some highlights and lowlights of the Super Bowl XLVIII spots. — STUART ELLIOTT     6:12 P.M.Warm Up, Get Ready, and Wait   Football coaches are notorious creatures of habit, and among those habits is programming every minute leading up to kickoff of a game. The Super Bowl is where season-long habits go to die. The Broncos and the Seahawks have been shooed from the field to make room for pregame pageantry, and they will be forced to sit — and sit, and sit — for roughly 30 minutes until the game starts. It is just one thing that makes the Super Bowl a bit of a different experience for teams. The length of the halftime show is another. We wrote about this a few years ago, when the Giants and Patriots played in the Super Bowl. Their coaches, Tom Coughlin and Bill Belichick, are not known for having the patience of today’s coaches, Seattle’s Pete Carroll and Denver’s John Fox. — JOHN BRANCH     6:13 P.M.The Mini-Opera We Did Not See   Renée Fleming, who will be performing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in a few minutes, had a vision in her head of bringing dancers with her to the Super Bowl to turn the national anthem into a live opera on the field. Instead, she decided to play it straight and perform with a recording by the New Jersey Symphony. While people were betting heavily on her going over the standard 1 minute 40 seconds, Fleming was mostly concerned about how being amplified would affect her performance. The native of Rochester was hardly worried about the cold. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     6:05 P.M.Clichés Are a Super Bowl Tradition Too   After Broncos receiver Eric Decker tells Fox about how it’s been a week full of emotion but “now it’s time to play some football,” Richard Sherman’s not looking so bad anymore, is he? Usually you have to wait until after the game to ignore insight like that. — ANDREW DAS     6:00 P.M.New York Loves a Party   Known as the city that never sleeps, New York welcomed the Super Bowl spectacle with open arms. The big game was met with no shortage of big parties, so many in fact that ones that would normally be considered a hot ticket were all of a sudden a lot easier to get into. Consider that Jay Z’s Roc Nation Sports party at the 40/40 Club on Saturday night, attended by the Yankees ace C.C. Sabathia, a Roc Nation client, and former and current N.F.L. players like LaDainian Tomlinson and Adrian Peterson, was actually overshadowed by the DirecTV party at New York’s Pier 40 stadium, hosted by, you guessed it, Jay Z, with a special appearance by his wife, Beyoncé. That did not dampen the mood at the 40/40 Club, where Eagles linebacker Mychal Kendricks and friends occupied a prime table. Mistaken by some as the hip-hop artist Chris Brown, Kendricks relished the attention. Even Brown’s ex-girlfriend Rihanna sees a resemblance, recently naming Kendricks her crush on “Man Crush Monday” on Twitter. Other hot tickets were parties held by Maxim (including Justin Bieber misbehaving), Playboy (situated between the Intrepid museum and the Bud Light Hotel) and ESPN (headlined by the singer Robin Thicke). At the FoxSports1 party in the Meatpacking District on Thursday, Aaron Paul of “Breaking Bad” had his picture snapped with Bill Murray as the band Kings of Leon played. The Lombardi Trophy was also in attendance. Even the news media received a party: the N.F.L’s media party Tuesday at Chelsea Piers had food stands featuring some of New York’s top restaurants and guest appearances by D.J. Questlove of the Roots and Constantine Maroulis of “American Idol” and the Broadway show “Rock of Ages.” — MELISSA HOPPERT     5:51 P.M.Live by the App, Die by the App   The fans are all charged up. Or they were hours ago. Now some of them are discovering that their cellphones are running low, and they are desperate to find a charger. “It took forever to get here,” said Jordan Springer of Mercer Island, Wash., who said he had downloaded a transit app on his Apple iPhone before he boarded the train from Manhattan. He talked to people in Seattle on the way to MetLife Stadium. “And I was taking pictures, which I sent,” he said. Gerard Smith of Garden City, N.Y., borrowed a charger from a reporter in the auxiliary press box when he realized his iPhone was also close to death. “I was taking a thousand pictures the moment I walked in,” he said, adding that he was thinking about finding a phone with longer battery life. But that will have to wait until after the game. — JAMES BARRON     5:47 P.M.From the Bargain Basement to the Super Bowl     You’d have to go back 15 Super Bowls to find a QB who made less than Russell Wilson ($526,217).

Because that conversation’s been going on for years, and I routinely hear Manning mentioned in it. — ANDREW DAS     5:34 P.M.The Seahawks’ Not-So-Secret Weapon   Seattle wide receiver Percy Harvin missed all but one regular-season game because of hip surgery. Although he returned for the divisional playoff round, he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the N.F.C. championship game. Despite all of that, look for the Seahawks to attempt to establish Harvin early as a threat. He can serve as an effective decoy, if not much more. — TOM PEDULLA     5:36 P.M.Let’s Drink Responsibly    Photo  Denver Broncos fans cheers each other before the start of the game.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times       5:36 P.M.Inactives List Released   The official inactive lists for the game were just distributed to the news media.

If their reception was any indication of how this game is going to go crowd-wise, this place is hugely pro-Broncos. Richard Sherman led out the Seahawks players to a mix of cheers and boos, but when a few Broncos players came out the stadium erupted. The crowd will be the only familiar thing for Denver, as the stadium sits roughly 5,273 feet lower elevation-wise than Mile High Stadium. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     5:27 P.M.When You Least Expect It    So who predicted it would be 54 degrees in East Rutherford today? #SuperBowl //t.co/CKUTb2JjKe — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 2 Feb 14  — STEVE EDER     5:23 P.M.Super Bowl Boulevard Is No More    Photo  Construction crews dismantle the Super Bowl Boulevard.Credit Melissa Hoppert/The New York Times   On Sunday, Super Bowl Boulevard, an open-air football festival that one F.B.I. official called a “street fair on steroids,” was all but gone. The wildly popular toboggan ride was stowed away on a trailer ready to be hauled away, and New York City sanitation trucks worked to polish Broadway from 34th Street to 47th Street as vendors sold official Super Bowl XLVIII programs. Many of the temporary news media studios remained. Outside Macy’s, a hub for all things Super Bowl, fans lingered around ESPN’s set in Herald Square. All week ESPN anchors had to compete with a booming light and sound show set that transformed the department store’s iconic facade into an outdoor theater. The 10-minute video, which had nine daily shows, dazzled fans, even if it also strained their necks. Inside the store, an N.F.L. pop-up shop, a 36,000-square-foot space on the fourth floor, was a popular destination. Already picked over by the weekend, the New York-New Jersey Super Bowl merchandise was among the most popular items.

Russell said he visualizes success before each game and knowledge of the stadium enhances those mental images. “I believe in making sure my mind is ready to go,” he said. — TOM PEDULLA     4:36 P.M.When Do the Shirts Start Coming Off?    And we have a sighting of a fan wearing shorts at the “cold weather” Super Bowl. //t.co/3suVEpFU2r — Benjamin Hoffman (@BenHoffmanNYT) 2 Feb 14  — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     4:27 P.M.At Secaucus, It’s Not the Cold, It’s the Humidity   Once fans arrived at Secaucus on New Jersey Transit around 2 p.m., many encountered a nearly hourlong wait, in blistering heat, before passing through a security  checkpoint and reaching their connecting trains to MetLife Stadium. “I’m going to lose about five pounds,” said Karin Rivale, of Aurora, Colo., the floor moist beneath her as fellow travelers began peeling off layers. Seahawks and Broncos fans joined in cries of “A.C.” in a plea for a cooler train station. When one group attempted a call-and-response chant of “Sea!” and “Hawks!” a Broncos fan, Matt Budreau, interceded. “Sea!” the fans said. “Caucus!” Budreau replied. But as the line stagnated near the station rotunda, he came to regret his endorsement of the city. “I’m reconsidering Secaucus,” he said, drenched in sweat. “They put the B.O. in Super Bowl.” Other jeers from the crowd included shouts of “T.S.A!” and “Blame Christie!” (An emergency responder, scanning the crowd for anyone struggling with the conditions, could not conceal a smile at the gubernatorial jab.) Around 3 p.m., the bottleneck appeared to ease at least slightly, in part because personnel stopped checking train tickets immediately after riders cleared security. (They checked at platforms, a New Jersey Transit spokesman, John Durso Jr. said.) “Just feed them through!” an officer shouted. Durso said that as of 3 p.m., New Jersey Transit had carried 13,500 people to the stadium complex. But not every rider got all the way there. Attendees were required to show game tickets at Secaucus before traveling to the stadium. “A sizable number” were turned away because they could not produce tickets, Durso said, declining to estimate more precisely. — MATT FLEGENHEIMER     4:17 P.M.Calm Broncos Fans: Confidence or Experience?

The Wickeses were among the early arrivals to the stadium, getting here just before 2 p.m. when the gates opened. They were hoping to take part in some of the pregame festivities.  It was a similarly easy trip for Tom and Lori Williams, who piled into an S.U.V. with three of their sons, all Seahawks fans from Whippany, N.J. “It was very straightforward,” Tom Williams said, adding that it took about 30 minutes. Mark Lyons and Bryan Maxwell, who were driving buses chartered by Stub Hub, were among the first to pull in near Stadium Entry Pavilion 2. “It was really smooth, believe it or not,” said Lyons, 48. “I’m impressed it went as smoothly as it did. It feels secure. It feels efficient.” The drivers now must wait for the game to end — and their fingers are crossed that the “second half” of their work day will be as easy as the first. — STEVE EDER     3:32 P.M.Super Bowl Week Was Rockin’   Super Bowl XLVIII has been as much about water as it was expected to be about snow. The Broncos’ media availability all week was held aboard the Cornucopia Majesty, the largest luxury party ship in the Northeast at 30,000 square feet. The ship, which was docked outside the Jersey City Hyatt, where the team was staying, has five dining rooms and can accommodate up to 1,200 guests. Peyton Manning was not a big fan. “I wasn’t prepared for this rocking cruise ship,” Manning said when asked if there had been any holes in his preparation for the game. “There’s always a wrinkle to keep you on your toes.”   Another player, safety David Bruton, was asked what he thought of the ship on the first night of availability after the team’s arrival. “I hear it’s very nice,” he said in a nod to the whirlwind that is Super Bowl week. In addition to the players’ boat, there was the Bud Light Hotel, a lodging and entertainment site aboard Norwegian Cruise Line’s newest ship. The Getaway, which holds 4,028 passengers, was docked next to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum on the West Side of Manhattan. There was even a small cruise ship docked next to the Taste of the N.F.L.’s Party With a Purpose on Saturday at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal for revelers seeking a change of scenery. The Broncos, who as the week wore on seemed to get their sea legs, will now do their best to find their balance on the field at MetLife Stadium. — MELISSA HOPPERT     3:23 P.M.Chants and Massages Begin at Penn Station   Early Sunday afternoon, fans attempted to navigate Pennsylvania Station in New York, approaching New Jersey Transit workers holding “Ask Me” signs. Where, one traveler asked, could riders find the connecting trains to MetLife Stadium once they arrived in Secaucus? “Follow everybody else,” an employee said. Though winding lines formed beside ticket windows as early as 1 p.m., many fans said that the first leg of their trip — getting to Secaucus — had gone relatively smoothly, despite the swelling crowds. Still, visitors appeared to greet Penn Station itself, long derided by locals, with ambivalence. “It’s functional,” said Toby Anderson, 45, a Broncos fan from Sacramento. “As far as the cleanliness, you know, what are you going to do?” Along platforms and near ticket machines, a series of chants and taunts filled the space: “Go Hawks!,” “Omaha!” and, in one clear reach, “Peyton Manning is mediocre at best.” Other atypical occurrences for the station included fans happily snapping photographs at ticket windows and at least one Seahawks supporter massaging the shoulder of a New Jersey Transit employee. Then there were the regular commuters, caught in the undertow of Russell Wilson jerseys. “I have no involvement with the Super Bowl,” Ashley Glaser, 19, a student from Park Ridge, N.J., said to a ticket agent. “I just want to get home.” Glaser said in an interview moments later that the scene on St.Patrick’s Day had probably been worse. But she cautioned that it was early. “No one is too drunk yet,” she said. — MATT FLEGENHEIMER     3:14 P.M.The 12th Man Settles In    Photo  Credit Bob Eckstein       2:57 P.M.Seated With Time to Spare   The main concerns with a New York Super Bowl were the potential for cold weather and the problems with transporting so many people through the New York metropolitan area. Having left Manhattan in the first wave of media buses, I was able to get here and through security without any issues. Now seated in the auxiliary press box, the massive heating system installed to deal with the weather is so strong that no jacket is needed. So if the hiccups are transportation and weather, the N.F.L. is 2 for 2 so far. The lack of vegetarian meal options will have to be investigated, but otherwise we’re all systems go. There are not enough fans in the stands to get an idea of whether this crowd will be rooting for Denver or Seattle, but one thing is clear: Against the gray seats of MetLife Stadium, the orange Broncos jerseys show up quite a bit better than the blue and gray Seahawks jerseys, so it may end up looking like a Broncos home game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN     1:30 P.M.Security and a Sense of Humor, Maybe   Media Bus No. 1 was scheduled to leave Times Square for MetLife Stadium at 1:15 p.m. It was full by 12:15 — a 56-passenger commuter bus packed with reporters and photographers. Then came the security check. Two police officers and a dog boarded about 12:35 and walked though the bus. The dog looked happy to be working the aisle. “I trust dogs more than i trust humans when it comes to that stuff,” a radio reporter said. “A dog’s never going to get lazy.” Apparently the dog didn’t find anything amiss, and having completed their rounds, the dog and the officers left.  “You’re in lockdown,” one of the officers said as he went down the steps past the driver. “Just kidding.” But the driver closed the door and no one has gotten on or off since. Departure time remained 1:15. — JAMES BARRON     1:15 P.M.The Week Was Often Not About Football   I got a chance to take in the atmosphere of Super Bowl week from a couple of locations.  Illustration by Bob Eckstein Bob Eckstein — BOB ECKSTEIN     10:30 A.M.Unzip the Parkas, This Will Be No Ice Bowl    Photo  A security guard had a quiet moment at MetLife Stadium.Credit Charlie Riedel/Associated Press   There is an old Scandinavian saying that roughly translates to, “There is no bad weather, only bad clothing.” Early last week, it looked as if 80,000 fans in MetLife Stadium would be testing that theory in real time when the Seahawks played the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII. But having bet on the league’s ability to handle its first cold-weather Super Bowl, the N.F.L. has seemingly caught a break. The temperature at kickoff is expected to be as high as the mid-40s, falling short of the coldest in Super Bowl history, a distinction held by Super Bowl VI in New Orleans. It was 39 degrees at Tulane Stadium when Mike Clark of the Dallas Cowboys kicked off to Mercury Morris of the Miami Dolphins and 81,023 people watched the Cowboys win, 24-3. With Sunday’s weather largely taken out of the equation, the fans in the stadium and at home will be free to focus on the matchup of the most productive offense in N.F.L. history and a young defense that already appears to be one of the best ever assembled. As with all Super Bowls, there have been plenty of subplots to keep people talking. The players were hounded all week, and the consensus from the news media was that Richard Sherman talked too much, Marshawn Lynch talked not enough, and Peyton Manning was just right. Along the way, there was enough discussion of Macklemore and legalized marijuana to make you occasionally forget that a football game was going to be played. But when the ball kicks off sometime after 6:25 p.m. Eastern, the N.F.L. will have its two best teams playing in the nation’s biggest market, which, before it even starts, has to be considered a huge success. — BEN HOFFMAN    Even the most ardent fans of the Seattle Seahawks were likely not predicting Super Bowl XLVIII to be so lopsided. From the flubbed snap on the game’s first play right up through the fourth quarter, Seattle outplayed the Denver Broncos in every way. A week that was dominated with talk of Peyton Manning’s legacy ended up with one of the most embarrassing losses in Super Bowl history, and Manning was largely responsible for his team’s struggles. This Super Bowl proved a number of things: Experience can sometimes be less important than talent; a great defense and a good offense beat a great offense and a mediocre defense; and just because you call something “the first cold-weather Super Bowl” does not mean it will actually be cold. MetLife Stadium proved to be a good site for the actual game, with the main issues centering on the inability to provide adequate public transportation for the 80,000-plus fans in attendance. Whether or not there is another outdoor Super Bowl in a cold-weather city is uncertain. Commissioner Roger Goodell was noncommittal when asked about plans for more. But it would be surprising for the league not to try again after this experiment has seemingly been a huge success. As the few remaining fans (all of whom appear to be Seahawks fans) linger in the stadium’s lower seats, the N.F.L. season is officially over. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Apparently all of Richard Sherman’s powers of braggadocio were contained in his injured ankle. His postgame comments, even if they were screamed, seem like the words of a much more humble and gracious man than the one the world met after the N.F.C. championship game. “We had a lot of hard work, a lot of dedication and the team deserves it,” Sherman said. “Russell Wilson, Earl Thomas and Kam Chancellor, they deserve this. The ‘Legion of Boom,’ baby. I hope we etched our names in the history books. This is the No. 1 offense in the history of the N.F.L. and we were able to play a good game against them. Peyton Manning may go down as one of the greatest to ever play the game, and we’re just blessed to have an opportunity to play against him. I can’t believe it.” — BENJAMIN HOFFFMAN Marshawn Lynch was noted for being tight-lipped all week. He kept that up in his press availability after the game. He answered three of the questions with a total of 12 words. But he did open up about not celebrating on the field: “Man, they know how I feel about it. This is big time. This has been a tradition since I came, since forever. It’s just what I do. Everybody knows it. They respect it.” For Lynch, that was quite a bit of talking. For his teammate Richard Sherman, that would barely be enough words to clear his throat. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN “We had bounce-right, counter-right. We were calling for it all week. We knew it was a good chance. We had to put that on film all year, and the guys did a heck of a job blocking. As soon as I caught the ball it was open field.” — Percy Harvin on his 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN  The whistle has blown, the Seahawks have won and the ad bowl within Super Bowl XLVIII is over. A quick wrap on the last quarter: 11 spots, by my count, on par with the third quarter, also 11, confirming previous patterns of networks running more spots in the first half than in the second half, as insurance against just the kind of lopsided result there was Sunday night. Many might say the ad bowl saved the best for last, or at least the most-watched and most-liked before the game for last, in that “Puppy Love” spot for Budweiser ran in the fourth quarter. It kicked off an all-nice, all-awwwwww, hap, hap, happy commercial pod; it was followed by a cheery song in a GoDaddy spot and the second of two Doritos spots that won a consumer contest, which featured a boy, a dog and a cute ending. (Question for the creator of the Doritos spot: Do kids really still play cowboys, or is that something out of “Dennis the Menace”?) Another notable ad in the fourth quarter was for SodaStream, featuring Scarlett Johansson. It had a different line from a previous version because Fox would not let the company knock Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola as it wanted to do. (The spot Fox would not run was uploaded to YouTube, a strategy that SodaStream followed last year, too, when CBS rejected a Coke/Pepsi poke in an ad.)  In an unfortunate juxtaposition, the SodaStream spot was preceded by one of three ads for T-Mobile; the third T-Mobile spot was a plain-looking thing, with only text on screen, and joked that maybe next year T-Mobile would run an ad with “overpaid movie stars.” Then came the SodaStream spot with Ms. Johansson. Oops! The 11 ads in the fourth quarter, added to 11 in the third, 17 in the second and 15 in the first, brings the Super Bowl XLVIII ad count to 54. That is about par for recent ad bowls. Looking back across the entire evening, there were some dominant themes and approaches among the spots. Patriotic appeals and celebrations of Americana were plentiful, in ads for, among others, WeatherTech, Chrysler and Coca-Cola. As noted in a previous post, the parade of stars was one of the biggest in recent Super Bowls, with the later quarters adding to the ranks Ms. Johansson, Danica Patrick, three cast members of “Full House,” three British actors known for playing bad guys, Johnny Galecki, Richard Lewis, Bob Dylan, Bruce Willis, Laurence Fishburne and Mandy Patinkin. And there was, in general, a sweeter tone to many of the ads compared to previous years when sexy sales pitches, sight gags and sarcasm predominated. To be sure, there were some brands that sought to be “daring,” like Butterfinger with the sex joke in the marriage counselor’s office. But brands like Bank of America, Beats Music, Budweiser,  Cheerios, Chevrolet, Coca-Cola, Doritos, GoDaddy, Honda, Microsoft and Toyota took a higher road. Be sure to come back here on Monday, and check the print edition of The New York Times, for another look back at all the ads of Super Bowl XLVIII. — STUART ELLIOTT An announcement was just made in MetLife Stadium that anyone hoping to use public transportation should remain inside the stadium until given further instruction. Congestion is apparently so bad that the platforms cannot handle the waiting passengers. As the night starts to get colder, the success of the first cold-weather outdoor Super Bowl could be tarnished if fans are expected to stand around for too long. The line for the train at MetLife is really long. #Super Bowl //t.co/Q2A1IMLzdc — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 3 Feb 14 — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Malcolm Smith was named the Super Bowl most valuable player. The award had gone to an offensive player in 40 of the previous 47 Super Bowls, but Smith’s interception and fumble recovery were crucial to the Seattle win. All week the team’s secondary, known as the Legion of Boom, got the attention, but it was Smith who intercepted a pass to clinch the N.F.C. championship, and once again he came up huge for his team. The third-year player was the 242nd pick in the 2011 draft. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN There is blue and green confetti everywhere, with plenty of it still floating in the air. My colleague Steve Eder points out “there are cannons full of orange and blue confetti somewhere sitting unused, right?” It makes you wonder if that confetti is then sent to lesser events, similar to the way the “Denver Broncos Super Bowll XLVIII Champions” t-shirts will all be sent to developing countries. What happens to all the unused orange and blue confetti? #SuperBowl //t.co/ZSnDKJ3pRM — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 3 Feb 14 — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN The concourse outside the open-air press box became a sea of orange as Denver Broncos fans fled. One man in an orange Broncos jacket and cap, who said his name was Mike, had three words for what had happened in the stadium. “Epic failure,” he said. “Disappointing.” “It’s just football, though, you know what I mean?” he said. “There’s more important stuff in life than football games.” And no, he would not say what his last name was. “I’m a family member of a player,” he said. — JAMES BARRON I feel like that Budweiser commercial made me want to buy a puppy more than buy Budweiser… — Jacob Giesler (@JacobGiesler) 3 Feb 14 The most anticipated commercial of the Super Bowl — and that’s because Budweiser floated this ad out early last week, and it stars a puppy — finally ran during the two-minute warning. Obviously, Budweiser was hoping its heartstring-pulling puppy/Clydesdale love story would get the most attention this late in the game. And that strategy backfired with a dreadful blowout that has put fans in a coma.  That said, you can’t not love this commercial. Hate Bud. Hate commercialism. Hate bad Super Bowls. But you have to love the puppy.   — LYNN ZINSER As the confetti was fired from cannons and fell back down onto the players’ heads, Van Halen played because a more recent song would just be far too scary. But for Seattle, a brand-new team with a young roster, this could be the first celebration of many, and a fresh song would have felt more appropriate.  Seattle won this game by sticking to the team’s principles and exploiting the weaknesses of a team that until now did not seem to have any flaws. It was a perfect example of playing together to reach a team goal. While some fans left early, undoubtedly trying to avoid the transportation nightmare they experienced getting here, most of the fans made it through a noncompetitive game that at some point started to feel like a commercial for just how good the Seahawks are.  Every Super Bowl team has its share of players who suddenly believe they should be paid far more money and leave the team for greener pastures, but this team is filled with lower-round draft picks in their first few seasons, so they should have at least a few more years together to continue to dominate the N.F.L. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN That’s it. A shockingly lopsided Super Bowl ends with a shockingly lopsided score. The Seahawks win their first title, and Peyton Manning is the bridesmaid again.  The real star of the game was the Seattle defense, which produced a safety on the game’s first play and never let up. The Broncos didn’t pick up a first down until the second quarter, but lost four turnovers and looked out of sorts all night.  Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson passed for 208 and 2 touchdowns (both the Jermaine Kearse) for Seattle, but more important avoided the mistakes that haunted Denver all night. In addition to Manning’s two interceptions, the Broncos had four fumbles, losing two of them. Manning finished with 34 completions (a Super Bowl record) and 280 yards, but he also threw two interceptions, including a crusher that Malcolm Smith returned for a touchdown in the second quarter.  Adding to his forgettable night: this crushing defeat was Manning’s 12th postseason loss, the most in N.F.L. history.  — ANDREW DAS Not surprisingly, Tarvaris Jackson (!) couldn’t lead the Seahawks into the end zone. So Manning will get a couple more plays here and we wind it down. Pete Carroll, meanwhile, will join Jimmy Johnson and Barry Switzer in adding a Super Bowl ring to an N.C.A.A. football championship. Well done. His team was unstoppable today. — ANDREW DAS He’s waiting just off the field, with his foot in a boot, to join in the celebrations. — ANDREW DAS Question: Can Tarvaris Jackson call himself a Super Bowl-winning quarterback after this game? I say yes. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Manning keeps trying, but at this point he’s just padding numbers no one’s going to remember. On fourth down he drops back and gets the ball knocked out of his hands by Chris Clemons as he throws. FUMBLE!!! And of course Seattle recovers it at the Denver 29. There’s 3:44 left and Seattle can rub their noses in it if they want. — ANDREW DAS — BOB ECKSTEIN With the Seahawks about to win a Super Bowl for the first time, the list of teams that have never won it all has shrunk to 13. The Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Cincinnati Bengals, Philadelphia Eagles, San Diego Chargers, Atlanta Falcons, Tennessee Titans, Carolina Panthers and Arizona Cardinals all came up empty in their Super Bowl appearances. The Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, Houston Texans and Jacksonville Jaguars have never even had the chance to lose. The Browns and Lions at least had a life before the Super Bowl, each winning N.F.L. championships before the creation of the league’s signature event.  Seattle will now have championships in football and basketball (Seattle Supersonics in 1978-79). The rabid sports fans of their city can now focus their attention on getting the Mariners and Sounders to join the city’s champions club. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN They are disconsolate, the Denver Broncos fans who have tickets that let them retreat to the huge, heated Lexus Club at MetLife Stadium. “I can’t stand to be outside waiting for my team to show up,” said Jim Grunditsch of Vail, Colo. “I can take three steps and get a painkiller, or stay outside, where Seattle fans will wave towels in my ear. What would you do?” Jamie Darvish, wearing a Washington Redskins jersey, said he too was rooting for Denver. He said he had paid $6,000 for a ticket with a face value of $2,500, but he had his reasons for leaving his seat and going inside. “It’s all Seattle fans where we are,” he said, “so I will stay in here. If you had to pick two teams that have the most-chilled fans, it would be these two. ‘Oh, that was tough. Sorry you missed that touchdown.’ But still.” — JAMES BARRON      Three quarters down, one to go, and already there is mumbling online about the lopsided score and whether advertisers in the second half of the game will regret their ad buys. That is why there historically have been more ads in the first half of a Super Bowl than in a second. Also, the last few games were close until the final whistle, so buying later in the game is not on its face a foolish idea.           In any event, there were by my count 11 national spots in the third quarter, including a biggie from Chrysler for the new Chrysler 200 with a new theme, “America’s import,” echoing “Imported from Detroit” with Eminem from a previous big game.           This time, Bob Dylan replaced Eminem and delivered a paean to American manufacturing and Detroit that was the second such spot in the game, after WeatherTech in the second quarter.            And who would have bet that two commercials in a 2014 Super Bowl would feature Mr. Dylan, much less two in the same quarter? A Chobani ad in the quarter used his song “I Want You.”            (Chobani brought another bear, too, after CarMax and Beats Music. Poor Stephen Colbert, he hates them!)          There were many kinder, gentler ads in the third quarter, among them the GoldieBlox girl power salute, sponsored by Intuit; Axe Peace’s paean to love; the Heinz ketchup salute to “happy”; Audi’s pitch for adopting rescue dogs; and a surprise Honda spot with Bruce Willis urging “hugs” as a proxy for auto safety.          Forty-three commercials down, by my count, let’s see what the fourth quarter brings. — STUART ELLIOTT Demaryius Thomas has 13 catches and was just targeted by Peyton Manning for the 17th time. He already holds the Super Bowl record for receptions, many of them coming against Richard Sherman, and has been the only thing working for Denver. He may not come away with a Super Bowl ring, but he has had a memorable performance. Unfortunately for the Broncos, he has been the only thing working on offense all game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Manning has 33 completions and Demaryius Thomas has 13 catches. Both are Super Bowl records. And nobody will care. The Broncos turn the ball over on downs. Just under 10 minutes left, and if this was a college game the walk-ons would be a getting a run. — ANDREW DAS He was helped off a few plays ago, limped behind the bench and now is riding to the locker room on a cart.  And you know what? He doesn’t have to say anything today. As Muhammad Ali famously noted, it ain’t bragging if you can back it up. — ANDREW DAS By my count, after tonight five Super Bowls will have been decided by 30 points or more. The Broncos will have been on the losing end of three of them. UPDATE: Yup, just checked. That’s right: Super Bowls XXII (vs. Redskins), XXIV (vs. 49ers) and XLVIII. — ANDREW DAS Those Denver fans had traveled so far, paid so much and come with such hope. And with a quarterback like Peyton Manning, some could still believe — even down by 36-8 in the third quarter.  But the truth is, Broncos fans have started heading for the exits at MetLife Stadium. More than one fan wearing a Manning No. 18 has been spotted inching toward the door. And it might be their best play of the night, especially for those relying on public transportation on the reverse commute. A bottleneck at Secaucus, N.J., made for a long, tough, journey to the game for some.  While Seattle’s big lead has made for a less competitive game, it might take some pressure off the transit system as the night wears on. Broncos fans have seen enough. #letsbeatthecrowds //t.co/ZfLHEEG9Mb — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 3 Feb 14 — STEVE EDER Denver really comes up small after ending the shutout. After recovering an onside kick and taking a penalty, Seattle drives 58 yards in five plays, all Wilson completions, including a 10-yarder to Kearse for the touchdown.  It’s a slaughter. It’s Bears-Patriots. It’s Ravens-Giants. It’s 43-8.  Troy Aikman on Fox: “I don’t know what Denver’s doing.” None of us do. — ANDREW DAS Bob Dylan 1966: “Build a fire on main street and shoot it full of holes.” Dylan 2014: “We will build your car.” — Nicholas Thompson (@nxthompson) 3 Feb 14 In the endless string of car commercials, it is hard to stand out. One way to do it: Get Bob Dylan to remind you of your patriotic duty to buy American cars. Chrysler rolls out the ’60s icon to tell you it’s O.K. to buy Asian-built cellphones or drink German beer, but “We will build your car.” You have to get over the idea that Dylan is now selling cars in 2014 — and we know not all of you will be able to — but if you can, it’s pretty effective.  — LYNN ZINSER Rockies pitchers and catchers report in 13 days. — ANDREW DAS //t.co/tREOdio498 — Patrick Stewart (@SirPatStew) 3 Feb 14 No Bruce Willis are you even watching it — Jason Kirk (@JasonKirkSBN) 3 Feb 14 The dreary competitive tone of the game apparently called for a bit of heartwarming stagecraft from Madison Avenue. So, in comes Bruce Willis — not usually Mr. Heartwarming — to tell us to hug all our friends. Somehow this was a Honda ad. Too bad he started by saying, “Great game, huh?” Um, no. Budweiser came next with a hero’s welcome for a solder coming home to Winter Park, Fla. Was probably a bit over the top, but hey, who’s going to criticize for being to sentimental about soldiers? No one.   — LYNN ZINSER Here come the Broncos baby!! Well, not really. But Manning finds Demaryius Thomas from 14 yards (really nice catch under pressure, by the way) to spoil the shutout. (That catch was his 12th, a Super Bowl record, and pushed him over 100 yards for the game. So, um, yay for Thomas.) The Broncos go for 2, and Manning hits Welker out of the backfield for the conversion. Seahawks 36, Broncos 8. They’re just spoiling betting pools now. — ANDREW DAS With that touchdown, the Broncos are off the hook. They will not be the first Super Bowl team to be shut out. They are, however, still down by 28. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN There has never been a shutout in the Super Bowl, but the lowest score by a losing team came in the last cold-weather Super Bowl. In Super Bowl VI the Miami Dolphins scored just 3 points with a kickoff temperature of 39 degrees at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans.  Despite the Broncos currently losing 36-0 and having possibly the worst ever performance in a Super Bowl, their fans have stayed remarkably resilient. There are few empty seats, and the color orange is prominent throughout MetLife Stadium. While some have headed for the exits, the others have just stayed standing in their seats in stunned silence as their team’s rocket-fueled offense has looked absolutely pedestrian. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN If only Denver had had a signal early in this game that it wasn’t going to be its day …. — ANDREW DAS The Super Bowl most valuable player has been a defensive player seven times (in Super Bowl XII, two Cowboys defenders shared the award), and there is a strong likelihood that Malcolm Smith will make it eight. His pick-6 was completely demoralizing for the Broncos, and his fumble recovery certainly seems to have wrapped things up as Denver was moving the ball a little and suddenly was once again without the ball. The last defensive player to win was Dexter Jackson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl XXXVII. It’s only too bad for Smith that Al Davis is no longer with us. He loved nothing more than signing Super Bowl M.V.P.’s to ridiculous contracts. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Russell Wilson with a short ball to Jermaine Kearse at the 23. He spins out of the first tackle, then another, then dodges another Bronco. TOUCHDOWN! Yep, that’s it everyone.  Game. Over. 36-0. Five Broncos had a shot at Kearse. All of them missed. — ANDREW DAS — BOB ECKSTEIN Peyton Manning throws, And only bad things happen, I want to go home. — ANDREW DAS Manning with a nice midrange ball to Demaryius Thomas on a run down the seam, and it looks like a big gain at last — until he takes on a defender and fumbles the ball!!!! Malcolm Smith — of course — scoops it up at the 20 and returns it to his 27.  Wah, wah, waaaaaaaaaah. — ANDREW DAS Malcolm Smith has really good timing. An interception to end the N.F.C. championship game, a pick-6 in the Super Bowl and a fumble recovery in the Super Bowl. I do not think he will be getting a Christmas card from Peyton Manning. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN It’s so much more fun to watch FOX when it’s someone else being blitzed & sacked! #SuperBowl — Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) 3 Feb 14 Hours from now we’ll be asking what car company had a commercial with a weird dog breed. Wait, I’ve already forgot — Neil Budde (@neilbudde) 3 Feb 14 Yes, the Super Bowl has way too many car ads. And yes, most of them are fairly predictable. So, you have to tip your hat to Audi for the sheer absurdity of the Doberhuahua ad. It was a silly idea that the ad writers took to even sillier lengths. A dog show. Attacking guitars. Terrorizing a city street. They even get kudos for the tag line, “Compromise scares us too.”   — LYNN ZINSER There has never been a Super Bowl shutout. The lowest total came in Miami’s 24-3 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI, in 1972. It’s been 13 years since a team failed to reach double digits (Ravens 34, Giants 7 in 2001.) The Broncos, meanwhile, have just punted again. After running a draw play on third-and-10. It lost a yard.  Tick, tick, tick … — ANDREW DAS This Seahawks team is outrageously good and is the second-youngest team in the league. They are crushing the greatest regular-season offense in N.F.L. history, and they are not even making it look hard. It really is an embarrassment of riches in the N.F.C. West, where the 49ers could easily be the team running away with a win here and the Rams and the Cardinals are a lot better than people realize. Considering the hard-hitting nature of all four teams, the only thing holding them back in the next few years is how much they beat each other up. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN — BOB ECKSTEIN J.C. Penney was an early winner in the battle for Super Bowl viewers’ attention on Twitter. The department store chain tweeted what looked like two drunken tweets from its official corporate account: Who kkmew theis was ghiong tob e a baweball ghamle. #lowsscorinh 5_0 — JCPenney (@jcpenney) 2 Feb 14 Toughdown Seadawks!! Is sSeattle going toa runaway wit h this??? — JCPenney (@jcpenney) 3 Feb 14 The tweets set off a stream of reply tweets from fans and other brands.  @jcpenney Yo dudes – you need some pizza…? — Pizza Hut (@pizzahut) 3 Feb 14 .@JCPenney We know football goes great with Coors Light, but please tweet responsibly. — Coors Light (@CoorsLight) 3 Feb 14 Eventually, Penney ‘fessed up. Oops…Sorry for the typos. We were #TweetingWithMittens. Wasn’t it supposed to be colder? Enjoy the game! #GoTeamUSA //t.co/e8GvnTiEGl — JCPenney (@jcpenney) 3 Feb 14 — VINDU GOEL Via the Times copy desk: If this keeps up, Russell Wilson will have won as many Super Bowls as Peyton Manning.  And Trent Dilfer. And Brad Johnson. — ANDREW DAS I’m just not sure if that Scientology thing is gonna get picked up for a second season. — Ross Miller (@ohnorosco) 3 Feb 14 It’s not as if Scientology is new to the advertising game, and it has even dropped into Super Bowl broadcasts before. But it still makes you stop and puzzle a bit when a religion decides to find a parking spot amid soft drink and car ads. “Imagine technology and spirituality, combined…,” the ad says. Not sure anyone switches soft drink brands or cars because of a Super Bowl ad, so that makes switching religions an even longer shot, right?  — LYNN ZINSER THEIR FANS ARE CALLED THE 12TH MAN HAVEN’T YOU HEARD? RT @hochman 12 seconds into the first half, safety. 12 seconds in the second half, TD. — Ben Shpigel (@benshpigel) 3 Feb 14 Percy Harvin takes the second-half kickoff out of the air and takes off — and doesn’t stop until he’s in the end zone.  87 yards — TOUCHDOWN!! Deferring pays off Seattle; the Seahawks couldn’t have scripted that any better. And it’s 29-0. Ouch. — ANDREW DAS Here’s what Golden Tate had to say about the return of Percy Harvin when meeting with reporters this week: “I’m excited to see him. I’m especially excited to see him back there on kickoff return. If you kick the ball to us, you never know what’s going to happen with him.” An 87-yard kickoff return for a touchdown says Tate knows what he’s talking about. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN — BOB ECKSTEIN The scary thing about how well the Seahawks’ defense played in the first half is that it did so without sacking Peyton Manning even once. They have limited Manning to a passer rating of 46.3 with none of the Broncos’ famous receivers managing even 10 yards a reception. The Legion of Boom got most of the credit for Seattle’s defensive efficiency this season, but the team’s front seven did have the eighth-most sacks in the N.F.L. If Cliff Avril and Company can get to Manning in the second half, this could get even uglier than it already is. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Before the second half starts, take a moment to enjoy this review of Renée Fleming on the ArtsBeat blog. With Renée Fleming, Super Bowl XLVIII Gets an Operatic Opening Renée Fleming became the first opera singer to perform the national anthem at the Super Bowl on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., but the word “opera” went unmentioned in her introduction. New Jersey’s Bruce Springsteen performed at the halftime show in 2009, the year before his home state was awarded this year’s game. Guessing he still would have done it if asked. — ANDREW DAS  The second quarter is done, meaning the first half of the ad bowl inside Super Bowl XLVIII is done, too.       By my count, there were 16 commercials nationally in the second quarter, plus the Pepsi spot that ran a moment ago to promote Pepsi’s sponsorship of the halftime show.       Three of the spots in the quarter were from advertisers that did not previously raise their hands to say they were buying time on the game: Geico, Sonos and Subway. The Geico and Subway spots were not new; not sure about the Sonos spot. Spots not made for the Super Bowl, or making their debut on the game, are usually less liked than all-new ones, and sure enough, there have been several complaints on Twitter already about the Geico and Subway spots.        Other highlights included the following:       * The first of two spots for Coca-Cola was shown, with a very definitive message about diversity and inclusion, coming as Coca-Cola is facing protests from activists unhappy that the company, which is also sponsoring the Winter Games in Sochi, Russia, has not come out against the Russian treatment of gays. In a news release, Coca-Cola said that it would show a longer version of the spot during the Olympics. The multicultural, multiracial cast included a vignette that by my eye was meant to be a same-sex male couple with their daughter.         * WeatherTech ran its commercial about making its products in America, a topic very much in the news.          * Some spots with sweet themes and content were shown, including the Toyota Highlander spot with the Muppets serenade, the Volkswagen spot riffing off the line from “It’s a Wonderful Life” about how angels get their wings and of course the Coke spot.          The 16 spots in the second quarter, the Pepsi spot and the 15 spots in the first quarter total 32 commercials beamed into living rooms and onto second screens nationally.          On to the second half. — STUART ELLIOTT I will give Bruno Mars this: He stuck to his promise to make the performance about his songs. The stage theatrics were minimal and his band put on a good show. It seemed anticlimactic when you consider some of the megastars who preceded him, but he certainly acquitted himself well. And it was a good move by the N.F.L. to embrace a current artist, as the league has often been overly safe. Of course, midway through the show the Red Hot Chili Peppers came out to sing songs that were popular 20 years ago, so it’s still baby steps. .@BrunoMars is killing it. He’s still no @jtimberlake, but I’m with @NailaJeanMeyers on this: why not have a current, non-washed-up star? — Melissa Hoppert (@MHoppertNYT) 3 Feb 14 — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Before you kill Bruno Mars as not “Super Bowl quality” as a halftime performer, know that Up With People did the halftime show four times, and Carol Channing did it twice. — ANDREW DAS 1. Eli. 2. Archie. 3. Olivia. 4. Peyton. 5. Cooper. — ANDREW DAS If the Muppets can make a comeback maybe there’s a chance for Denver. — George Nicholson III (@gnicholson3) 3 Feb 14 Toyota used a second-quarter ad for the Highlander to answer the rhetorical question, is it possible to make a terrible ad starring the Muppets?  The answer, unfortunately, is yes. As a band of Muppets takes over driving a poor, unsuspecting man’s S.U.V., absolutely no hilarity ensues. In fact, it was painful to watch. Even Kermit looked pained at the end.  — LYNN ZINSER Russell Wilson: 9 of 14, 94 yards, 0 interceptions Peyton Manning: 17 of 23, 104 yards, 2 interceptions.  Anyone else identify the problem? The picks were crushing — sapping momentum and, of course, costing Denver 7 points on the Smith return. But 17 completions for only 104 yards? That’s not nearly good enough for Manning. The running games have been negligible: Percy Harvin is Seattle’s leading rusher, with two carries for 45 yards, but 30 came on one reverse. Marshawn Lynch has 17 yards on 11 carries, while Denver’s Knowshon Moreno has 5 carries for 17. — ANDREW DAS They have just turned off the heat lamps in the auxiliary press box for Not-Beyoncé’s performance. This is not making me like him more. But I’m willing to be turned around by a good show. So I hope he studied the Black Eyed Peas’ performance in Dallas and plans to do nothing like that. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Fox cut away before we could see if one of them stood up and said: “Hey, how about you stop complaining about us? And stop throwing the ball to the other team while you’re at it?” And that’s the half. Maybe the Broncos can hug it out in the locker room. — ANDREW DAS This game has been a little boring (unless you’re a Seahawks fan), and in a few minutes the halftime show is going to star Bruno Mars, whom I will refer to as Not-Beyoncé. In his news conference on Thursday, Not-Beyoncé seemed quite nice, and had very tall hair. But he failed at being Beyoncé in a way that is hard to describe. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Manning finds Moreno at the 20, but that’s short of the first down. Denver takes a timeout, then eschews the field goal and goes for it. Bad idea. Manning, under pressure, underthrows his receiver on the left sideline. So they get nothing. — ANDREW DAS You, Stephen Colbert got robbed! Nobody should have their commercials anywhere near David Beckham in his underwear. — Page (@ACaryGrantFan) 3 Feb 14 Stephen Colbert’s debut hawking pistachios had an interesting twist. The first part of the ad was unimpressive, unless you really like birds in fluorescent green ties. But if you hung through the beefcake ad that was David Beckham for H&M, you got the payoff. It was so fitting of a Colbert bit that you would swear he wrote it. Do you think he did?   — LYNN ZINSER Manning has quietly, and quickly, moved the Broncos to the Seattle 27, or what’s also known as field-goal range. At this point, given the way the half has gone, they’ll take anything that gets that goose egg off the scoreboard. — ANDREW DAS Unless things change rapidly, there will be plenty of jokes at Peyton Manning’s expense after this game. Some of the jokes will be deserved, but the truly unfortunate thing is that he will undoubtedly be judged as a failure to the legacy of John Elway. That shows a selective memory by Broncos fans, as Elway won two Super Bowls, but also lost three, including a 55-10 drubbing at the hands of Joe Montana and the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV. Regardless of the final result, Manning is an all-time great. If he were to come back and win a Super Bowl before retiring, his losses would be forgotten, just as they were for Elway. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Denver keeps the ball. — ANDREW DAS The officials give the ball to the Seahawks, but a replay sure makes it look as if he was down before the ball was out. There will be a review of the turnover. Denver needs this call. — ANDREW DAS Malcolm Smith, with crucial interceptions in consecutive playoff games, had two career interceptions heading into this year’s playoffs. Apparently the third-year player out of Southern California only goes for the ball when it really matters. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Among recent Denver Broncos quarterbacks, the strongest performer so far tonight is Tim Tebow, in something of an upset. — Ben Rothenberg (@BenRothenberg) 3 Feb 14 When T-Mobile announced it had signed Tim Tebow for a Super Bowl ad, well, it was going to be worth watching no matter what. The ad used the irony of Tebow being out of football perfectly, asking, “What can you do with out a contract?” Part of the answer was “find and tackle Sasquatch.” Not bad. T-Mobile hopes viewers like Tebow better than N.F.L. coaches did.  — LYNN ZINSER Manning is hit as he throws on third-and-long by Orlando Franklin, and the resulting duck is plucked out of the air by linebacker Malcolm Smith. And he’s gone — returning it 69 yards for a touchdown!  The only part of the play Smith bungled was his spike over the crossbar; after running more than 70 yards, he got only about nine feet high. Oh well, they don’t take points off the board for style. Seattle 22, Denver 0.  And the momentum that had been slowly shifting swings closed like a garden gate. Wow. — ANDREW DAS   And the first quarter of the ad bowl inside the Super Bowl is complete. Three quarters to go, assuming there is no overtime.      There were by my count 15 national commercials in the quarter, including two from the Bud Light #UpforWhatever campaign, much promoted before the game; two from Chevrolet, one with a charity component; one of two GoDaddy spots; another charity-themed ad, from Bank of America; the first commercial from Chrysler Group, for the new Maserati; and one of the winners of the annual Crash the Super Bowl contest sponsored by Doritos, inviting consumers to create ads.      Overall impressions so far are mixed, with a notable, if not uncommon observation: lots of celebrities. Three in the Bud Light spots, Ellen DeGeneres in the Beats Music spot, John C. Reilly supplying the narration in the TurboTax spot; John Turtorro helping a woman quit her job in the GoDaddy spot; U2 singing for Bank of America; and Jeff Bridges narrating the Hyundai Genesis spot.      Two charity ads in one quarter also seems to suggest a kinder kind of tone to the Super Bowl commercials.   — STUART ELLIOTT Malcolm Smith stepped right in front of a wobbling pass by Peyton Manning and took it back for a pick-six. It should be noted that it was Smith who was in such fantastic position to catch Richard Sherman’s deflection in the N.F.C. championship game that won it for Seattle. Manning’s second interception was an absolute crushing blow for Denver. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Kam Chancellor has returned to the game, but Denver has continued to show some movement for the first time this game. Peyton Manning is looking more animated and the Denver half of the crowd is waking back up. A score here would certainly be good for helping this game avoid turning into a blowout. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN With 10:30 left in the first half, Knowshon Moreno bulls over the right side for Denver’s first first down of the game. Is it the start of something? Let’s see them get another first. But don’t think for a minute that 15 points is enough against Peyton Manning. — ANDREW DAS Kam Chancellor seemed to be O.K. when walking off the field after being shaken up on a kickoff, but if he is unable to return it is hard to quantify how bad that would be for Seattle. One of the absolute keys to Seattle’s style of play is the interaction between Chancellor and Earl Thomas. Losing either safety for an extended period would hurt Seattle more than losing Richard Sherman, as hard as that is to believe (especially for Richard Sherman). — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Seattle’s Kam Chancellor, the hard-hitting defensive back, was injured making a tackle on the kickoff after the Seahawks touchdown. Always a peril when a starter plays on special teams. He’s walked off on his own. — ANDREW DAS Both Golden Tate and Doug Baldwin spent the week being asked about the return of Percy Harvin. While both remained optimistic that Harvin would be a huge help to the team, they also could be excused if they wanted some credit for helping get Seattle to the Super Bowl. One thing cited by all of the Seahawks was the presence Harvin would provide and how that would open things up for the other receivers. So far that seems to be working as Baldwin is the team’s leading receiver with 3 catches for 50 yards while Harvin’s contributions have come on running plays. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN — BOB ECKSTEIN After a pass interference calls gives them a first-and-goal, Seattle shifts into Beast Mode — with Marshawn Lynch slamming into the line twice and delivering a 1-yard touchdown. The extra point makes it 15-0 three minutes into the second quarter.  You’re fooling yourself if you don’t think it feels as if it should be a lot more. — ANDREW DAS Did Radio Shack just admit they are old and outdated? — Ken Boxx (@kboxx97) 3 Feb 14 Radio Shack decided to tease the coming redesign of its stores in hilarious fashion. “The ’80s called. It wants its store back.” So, in comes everything from Alf to Mary Lou Retton. Only possible problem? If you didn’t live through the ’80s, does any of that strike you as funny?  — LYNN ZINSER Turnovers and time of possession are often what people look to when trying to decide who will win a game. So far, this one is all Seattle. There are many slightly chilly fans wearing orange who are having second thoughts about paying four figures to go to a football game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Denver is actually pretty lucky it’s still a game. If the Broncos’ defense hadn’t held Seattle to two field goals, they’d be in danger of getting blown out in the next few minutes. — ANDREW DAS Sometimes Omaha means Omaha and Hurry means Hurry. And sometimes, it seems, the offensive linemen of the Denver Broncos aren’t sure which is which. That, at least, seemed to be what happened on the first play of the Super Bowl. Quarterback Peyton Manning stepped toward his linemen to scream instructions when the ball went flying past his head. Perhaps center Manny Ramirez misunderstood the snap count or saw Manning move in anticipation of a snap. Or perhaps Manning was being Manning and tried to call a new play based on how Seattle’s defense lined up. Manning, after all, is the master of the audible who uses a complex matrix of code words to alert his teammates of new plays while simultaneously deceiving defenses. The system works particularly well when Manning plays at home because Broncos fans (and Colts fans before them) lower their voices so the Broncos can hear Manning’s calls. During a playoff game against the Chargers several weeks ago, it was so quiet that microphones near the field picked up Manning yelling “Omaha” dozens of times. But at MetLife Stadium, Manning lined up near the Seattle end zone where many Seahawks fans were sitting. Could the 12th Man have helped their team score the first 2 points of the game? — KEN BELSON Nope. Even worse: Manning overthrows Julius Thomas down the middle on third down and the ball lands right in the arms of Seattle’s Kam Chancellor at the Denver 37.  Ruh roh.  Richard Sherman, your thoughts?  “ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! YOU’RE GOING TO TRY TO COME OVER THE MIDDLE WITH A SORRY THROW LIKE THAT! DON’T YOU EVER THROW THAT BALL!” Thanks, Richard. Talk later? — ANDREW DAS Kam Chancellor just did his best to lower the boom on Wes Welker. Luckily for Welker, Chancellor’s 6-foot-3 frame is simply too tall to get a clean hit on a 5-9 wide receiver. He shot right over him. Then Chancellor showed his versatility, picking off Manning and setting up yet another Seattle drive on offense. The Seattle secondary is easily looking as good as advertised. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Wilson finds Jermaine Kearse in the end zone, but Denver’s Nate Irving pops the ball out of his hands, so Hauschka comes on for another field goal. Seattle now leads, 8-0, in the third inning. I mean, first quarter. Denver Coach John Fox used his challenge just before the third-down play, to question whether an incompletion was actually a lateral. (He was wrong.) But the challenge almost seemed as if he was just buying his defense a minute to try to figure out what the heck is going on. To their credit, they’re keeping Manning in this game by forcing field goals. But they’ve been on the field A LOT in the early going. — ANDREW DAS The Seahawks have now scored three times, and yet Peyton Manning and the high-powered Broncos offense could tie the game with one touchdown and a 2-point conversion. While Denver has shown little ability to move the ball against Seattle, this game is still wide open. Considering how much Seattle has appeared to dominate on both sides of the ball, that’s truly remarkable.. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Well, Turbo Tax. Good commercial until it turned out to be for Turbo Tax. — Steve Hofstetter (@SteveHofstetter) 2 Feb 14 Turbo Tax has turned up its ad game for this tax season, with some nice, unusual ads this month, but its first Super Bowl effort really tested the edges of creativity. Since when does a high school prom-looking dance have something to do with online tax filing? Not sure I know even after watching it. But they get points for bold.  — LYNN ZINSER Marshawn Lynch has not done much so far (five carries for 6 yards), but Seahawks fans know a runner of Lynch’s style often takes quite a while to get going. On each play, Denver is committing multiple interior players to bringing the big running back down, and over the course of the game those big players tend to wear down. If Seattle shows a commitment to giving Lynch the ball, he’ll eventually find holes that are not opening so far. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Make that 7 of 10 for Wilson, for 82 yards, after Doug Baldwin runs under a beautifully floated pass over Champ Bailey for a 37-yard gain. First and goal at the 6. And Denver can’t seem to do anything to stop it. — ANDREW DAS Russell Wilson is 6 for 8 after a short pass to Percy Harvin, and the Broncos can’t seem to lay a glove on him. He’s had plenty of time in the pocket, but when there’s not enough, he’s gone. All the Broncos can do is chase. — ANDREW DAS Michael Robinson, who just reeled in a 7-yard catch, is useful for many things other than serving as the temporary voice of Marshawn Lynch (as he did during the Seahawks’ media availabilities). The big fullback was a quarterback and wide receiver during his time at Penn State. He is talked about a lot less than Derrick Coleman, but Robinson is a solid football player who contributes to Seattle in a number of ways. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN The Broncos go nowhere — a 3-yard run, and passes of 2 and 3 yards — but look at the bright side: At least they didn’t go backward. Eli Manning pulls out his cellphone and texts Peyton’s number. “Dude, when I won my TWO Super Bowls, he’s what we did …” — ANDREW DAS So far, bud light and Doritos are tied for “worst Super Bowl commercial in 2014” — Ant (@Soulvester) 2 Feb 14 The latest Doritos ad is always much anticipated in the Super Bowl, and the first one wasn’t a disappointment. It featured a kid-driven time machine that seems to work when Dad comes out to discover his son has gotten old — or not. It wasn’t worth a belly laugh, but worth a smile.  — LYNN ZINSER It should be pointed out as often as possible that Knowshon Moreno’s name is a combination of his father’s nickname (Knowledge) and his mother’s name (Varashon). — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Five minutes into the game, he’ll get to touch the ball for the first time — on Denver’s second play. — ANDREW DAS Holding the Seahawks to a field goal has to be seen as a victory for the Broncos. Off to a brutal start in which their one offensive play resulted in 2 points for the Seahawks, the Broncos now have the ball back and are less than a touchdown behind. As for the cold weather, it is official that Super Bowl VI will keep its title as the coldest Super Bowl on record. At kickoff it was a balmy 49 degrees, or 10 degrees warmer than the Broncos and the Dolphins had way back when. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Carroll was wrong, and it’ll cost him a timeout. A penalty pushes the Seahawks back as they line up to kick, but Steven Hauschka laughs at your extra 5 yards — hahaha! — and bangs the kick from 31. Seattle 5, Denver 0 with 10:21 left in the first quarter.  If you thought that 5 you drew in your Super Bowl squares was never going to happen, things may be looking up for you. — ANDREW DAS It’s really easy to forget about Russell Wilson as a runner. The Seahawks’ offense is focused so heavily on Marshawn Lynch that Wilson flies under the radar in terms of his ability to scramble and do planned runs. But that speed, which he used to set up a fourth-and-1 (Seattle challenged the play but the call on the field stood), is a weapon not only on a broken play, but also to give him time to throw. Denver’s defense is nothing special, and chasing Wilson all day will wear out their front seven. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Seattle gets to Denver’s 14, but on third-and-6 Russell Wilson keeps the ball and rolls left — diving for the first-down marker. He ends up a yard short though, so Seattle will have to settle for a field goal. But hold on — Pete Carroll is challenging the spot? Replays show he’s wasting his time. — ANDREW DAS 6,000-1 safety on first play. Think about that. — Matt Hayes  (@Matt_HayesSN) 2 Feb 14 How much do you believe in momentum? The Seahawks were gifted a 2-0 lead on a bad snap (the resulting safety was the fastest score in Super Bowl history) and Percy Harvin, who had all of one catch this season, just reeled off a huge run. With the Seahawks now in the red zone, the Broncos have immediately been put on their heels, and if Seattle can score on this possession Denver will have quite a hole to climb out of. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN After the penalty forces a short kickoff, Seattle safely navigates a first down and then hands to Percy Harvin on a reverse. Only a step out of bounds after a 30-yard gain prevents a touchdown.  Denver appears to be on Mountain time still. Better get the engine firing soon, because Seattle is flying. — ANDREW DAS After the Broncos’ Trindon Holliday runs the kickoff back to only the 14, Peyton Manning steps up to change the play on first down as his center, Manny Ramirez, snaps the ball over his head.  The Broncos’ Knowshon Moreno covers it in the end zone, but that’s a safety. (They actually had a penalty on the play too, so, you know, great job guys.) Seattle 2, Denver 0 after 12 seconds. — ANDREW DAS So much talk this week centered on experience. Peyton Manning, the most experienced man on the field, just flubbed a snap that resulted in a safety and a 2-0 lead for Seattle. So I guess maybe experience isn’t everything? — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Seattle has elected to have its defense on the field to start the game. That makes sense considering the Legion of Boom is undoubtedly excited to get … booming. Receiving the ball to start the second half will be nice as well. If only Matt Hasselbeck, the former Seahawks quarterback, had been there to declare, “We want the ball and we’re going to score!” as he did after winning a coin toss before overtime in 2004. Of course, the Seahawks lost that game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN But only after the referee almost steals Joe Namath’s thunder by flipping the coin himself. I guess the players aren’t the only ones with nerves. Seattle will kick off. Enjoy the game. — ANDREW DAS Untrue Super Bowl Fact No. 1: A team led onto the field by a woman on a white horse has never lost the Super Bowl. — ANDREW DAS There was one thing that could unite Broncos and Seahawks fans on Sunday: public transportation. As fans wearing both teams’ colors spilled into MetLife Stadium, a number were sharing tales of a “horrible” commute to the game. It was those who took trains from Manhattan through Secaucus who seemed to have gotten the worst of it. There, fans described a scene where it was hot — they guessed that it was over 95 degrees. They said they saw people fainting. Some said people were urinating as they waited in the shoulder-to-shoulder crowds. “It was an epic fail,” said Joe Knittel, 32, of Seattle, after he spent four hours making his way to the game from Manhattan, finally arriving about an hour before kickoff. Even after making it through Secaucus, he and his friends said they waited in a long line to enter the stadium. That, too, they said was problematic, as fans lining up outside the security screening tents freely cut in front of each other as busloads of people arrived, prompting arguing and shouting. — STEVE EDER — BOB ECKSTEIN Seattle cornerback Richard Sherman’s postgame rant to the Fox reporter Erin Andrews after the N.F.C. championship game, shortly after he made a critical defensive play that helped the Seahawks reach Super Bowl XLVIII, instantly catapulted him into the national spotlight. On the first day of player availability, shortly after the Seahawks touched down in New York, Sherman was surrounded by television cameras and reporters, about 20 people deep. Meanwhile, the Seahawks’ young star quarterback, Russell Wilson, had about only 20 people total lingering around his podium at the Jersey City Westin. The trend continued throughout the week, especially at media day, where Sherman drew the biggest crowd of players from both teams. Wilson did not seem to mind. Asked  if he was surprised that Sherman had received so much attention in the past week, he replied: “No. I mean, he’s a great football player.” Wilson, who also played minor league baseball, continued: “All of the things that he’s done for our football team, he deserves the attention with the way that he plays. I love that about Richard.” Sherman, laughing and smiling through it all, embraced the attention but also asked for his teammates to be recognized. “I think that these cameras could be anywhere,” he said. “They could be on all my teammates, and they deserve it.” — MELISSA HOPPERT The Seahawks are introduced first, and the boos that greet them give a sense of how the crowd is leaning. The Broncos run out next — to cheers. All expect for Peyton Manning, who walks on water. I kid. The Broncos follow a white charger onto the field. Very cool. The Seahawks only had their 12th Man flag. Advantage: Broncos. — ANDREW DAS  It is almost game time for Madison Avenue as well as for the N.F.L., as marketers and agencies get ready for the annual ad bowl inside the Super Bowl.    More than 50 commercials are planned to appear during the game, from a mix of mainstay Super Bowl advertisers — among them, Anheuser-Busch, Coca-Cola, General Motors, GoDaddy, Mars, movie studios and PepsiCo — and newcomers like Beats Music, Chobani yogurt, Jaguar, Squarespace and WeatherTech.     Although most of the commercials have been available for viewing before the game, in social media like YouTube, there are some that are being kept under wraps until they appear.     For instance, Chrysler said late on Friday that it would return. The company has garnered considerable attention in recent Super Bowls for spots with content that surprised viewers like a halftime appeal by Clint Eastwood.     Come back here during the game for comments after each quarter, looking at some highlights and lowlights of the Super Bowl XLVIII spots. — STUART ELLIOTT Football coaches are notorious creatures of habit, and among those habits is programming every minute leading up to kickoff of a game. The Super Bowl is where season-long habits go to die. The Broncos and the Seahawks have been shooed from the field to make room for pregame pageantry, and they will be forced to sit — and sit, and sit — for roughly 30 minutes until the game starts. It is just one thing that makes the Super Bowl a bit of a different experience for teams. The length of the halftime show is another. We wrote about this a few years ago, when the Giants and Patriots played in the Super Bowl. Their coaches, Tom Coughlin and Bill Belichick, are not known for having the patience of today’s coaches, Seattle’s Pete Carroll and Denver’s John Fox. — JOHN BRANCH Renée Fleming, who will be performing “The Star-Spangled Banner” in a few minutes, had a vision in her head of bringing dancers with her to the Super Bowl to turn the national anthem into a live opera on the field. Instead, she decided to play it straight and perform with a recording by the New Jersey Symphony. While people were betting heavily on her going over the standard 1 minute 40 seconds, Fleming was mostly concerned about how being amplified would affect her performance. The native of Rochester was hardly worried about the cold. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN After Broncos receiver Eric Decker tells Fox about how it’s been a week full of emotion but “now it’s time to play some football,” Richard Sherman’s not looking so bad anymore, is he? Usually you have to wait until after the game to ignore insight like that. — ANDREW DAS Known as the city that never sleeps, New York welcomed the Super Bowl spectacle with open arms. The big game was met with no shortage of big parties, so many in fact that ones that would normally be considered a hot ticket were all of a sudden a lot easier to get into. Consider that Jay Z’s Roc Nation Sports party at the 40/40 Club on Saturday night, attended by the Yankees ace C.C. Sabathia, a Roc Nation client, and former and current N.F.L. players like LaDainian Tomlinson and Adrian Peterson, was actually overshadowed by the DirecTV party at New York’s Pier 40 stadium, hosted by, you guessed it, Jay Z, with a special appearance by his wife, Beyoncé. That did not dampen the mood at the 40/40 Club, where Eagles linebacker Mychal Kendricks and friends occupied a prime table. Mistaken by some as the hip-hop artist Chris Brown, Kendricks relished the attention. Even Brown’s ex-girlfriend Rihanna sees a resemblance, recently naming Kendricks her crush on “Man Crush Monday” on Twitter. Other hot tickets were parties held by Maxim (including Justin Bieber misbehaving), Playboy (situated between the Intrepid museum and the Bud Light Hotel) and ESPN (headlined by the singer Robin Thicke). At the FoxSports1 party in the Meatpacking District on Thursday, Aaron Paul of “Breaking Bad” had his picture snapped with Bill Murray as the band Kings of Leon played. The Lombardi Trophy was also in attendance. Even the news media received a party: the N.F.L’s media party Tuesday at Chelsea Piers had food stands featuring some of New York’s top restaurants and guest appearances by D.J. Questlove of the Roots and Constantine Maroulis of “American Idol” and the Broadway show “Rock of Ages.” — MELISSA HOPPERT The fans are all charged up. Or they were hours ago. Now some of them are discovering that their cellphones are running low, and they are desperate to find a charger. “It took forever to get here,” said Jordan Springer of Mercer Island, Wash., who said he had downloaded a transit app on his Apple iPhone before he boarded the train from Manhattan. He talked to people in Seattle on the way to MetLife Stadium. “And I was taking pictures, which I sent,” he said. Gerard Smith of Garden City, N.Y., borrowed a charger from a reporter in the auxiliary press box when he realized his iPhone was also close to death. “I was taking a thousand pictures the moment I walked in,” he said, adding that he was thinking about finding a phone with longer battery life. But that will have to wait until after the game. — JAMES BARRON You’d have to go back 15 Super Bowls to find a QB who made less than Russell Wilson ($526,217). In 1999, Kurt Warner made $250K. — darren rovell (@darrenrovell) 2 Feb 14 Fox’s Jimmy Johnson just said that if Peyton Manning wins today, “he will be in the discussion as the greatest [quarterback] of all time.” Really Jimmy? Get out much? Because that conversation’s been going on for years, and I routinely hear Manning mentioned in it. — ANDREW DAS Seattle wide receiver Percy Harvin missed all but one regular-season game because of hip surgery. Although he returned for the divisional playoff round, he sustained a concussion that forced him to miss the N.F.C. championship game. Despite all of that, look for the Seahawks to attempt to establish Harvin early as a threat. He can serve as an effective decoy, if not much more. — TOM PEDULLA The official inactive lists for the game were just distributed to the news media.  Seahawks: Bryan Walters, WR; Christine Michael, RB; Michael Bowie, T; Caylin Hauptmann, T; Kellen Davis, TE; Benson Mayowa, DE; Jordan Hill, DT. Broncos: Zac Dysert, QB; Ronnie Hillman, RB; Quentin Jammer, CB; Vinston Painter, T; Chris Kuper, G; Joel Dreesen, TE; Sione Fuo, DT. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN A few players from both teams just ran onto the field. If their reception was any indication of how this game is going to go crowd-wise, this place is hugely pro-Broncos. Richard Sherman led out the Seahawks players to a mix of cheers and boos, but when a few Broncos players came out the stadium erupted. The crowd will be the only familiar thing for Denver, as the stadium sits roughly 5,273 feet lower elevation-wise than Mile High Stadium. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN So who predicted it would be 54 degrees in East Rutherford today? #SuperBowl //t.co/CKUTb2JjKe — Steve Eder (@SteveEder) 2 Feb 14 — STEVE EDER On Sunday, Super Bowl Boulevard, an open-air football festival that one F.B.I. official called a “street fair on steroids,” was all but gone. The wildly popular toboggan ride was stowed away on a trailer ready to be hauled away, and New York City sanitation trucks worked to polish Broadway from 34th Street to 47th Street as vendors sold official Super Bowl XLVIII programs. Many of the temporary news media studios remained. Outside Macy’s, a hub for all things Super Bowl, fans lingered around ESPN’s set in Herald Square. All week ESPN anchors had to compete with a booming light and sound show set that transformed the department store’s iconic facade into an outdoor theater. The 10-minute video, which had nine daily shows, dazzled fans, even if it also strained their necks. Inside the store, an N.F.L. pop-up shop, a 36,000-square-foot space on the fourth floor, was a popular destination. Already picked over by the weekend, the New York-New Jersey Super Bowl merchandise was among the most popular items.   Photo  The light show on the facade of Macy’s.Credit Melissa Hoppert/The New York Times   — MELISSA HOPPERT  — MELISSA HOPPERT — BOB ECKSTEIN In a sea of Peyton Manning and Marshawn Lynch jerseys at MetLife Stadium, there have been more than a few throwbacks to the earlier eras of both teams. From John Elway to Terrell Davis to Steve Largent, the fans are showing their loyalties in various ways. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Russell Wilson, Seattle’s second-year quarterback, said Thursday, the last day players were made available to the news media, that it would help him that the Seahawks played at MetLife Stadium earlier this season. They blanked the Giants, 23-0, on Dec. 15. Russell said he visualizes success before each game and knowledge of the stadium enhances those mental images. “I believe in making sure my mind is ready to go,” he said. — TOM PEDULLA And we have a sighting of a fan wearing shorts at the “cold weather” Super Bowl. //t.co/3suVEpFU2r — Benjamin Hoffman (@BenHoffmanNYT) 2 Feb 14 — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Once fans arrived at Secaucus on New Jersey Transit around 2 p.m., many encountered a nearly hourlong wait, in blistering heat, before passing through a security  checkpoint and reaching their connecting trains to MetLife Stadium. “I’m going to lose about five pounds,” said Karin Rivale, of Aurora, Colo., the floor moist beneath her as fellow travelers began peeling off layers. Seahawks and Broncos fans joined in cries of “A.C.” in a plea for a cooler train station. When one group attempted a call-and-response chant of “Sea!” and “Hawks!” a Broncos fan, Matt Budreau, interceded. “Sea!” the fans said. “Caucus!” Budreau replied. But as the line stagnated near the station rotunda, he came to regret his endorsement of the city. “I’m reconsidering Secaucus,” he said, drenched in sweat. “They put the B.O. in Super Bowl.” Other jeers from the crowd included shouts of “T.S.A!” and “Blame Christie!” (An emergency responder, scanning the crowd for anyone struggling with the conditions, could not conceal a smile at the gubernatorial jab.) Around 3 p.m., the bottleneck appeared to ease at least slightly, in part because personnel stopped checking train tickets immediately after riders cleared security. (They checked at platforms, a New Jersey Transit spokesman, John Durso Jr. said.) “Just feed them through!” an officer shouted. Durso said that as of 3 p.m., New Jersey Transit had carried 13,500 people to the stadium complex. But not every rider got all the way there. Attendees were required to show game tickets at Secaucus before traveling to the stadium. “A sizable number” were turned away because they could not produce tickets, Durso said, declining to estimate more precisely. — MATT FLEGENHEIMER — BOB ECKSTEIN Bubba, a handsome 9-year-old golden Labrador retriever, and his handler, Inspector Amanda Mostek, were among those working to keep the Super Bowl safe. Mostek presented their business card after Bubba joined other canines in inspecting bags carried by the news media that typically contain laptops, media guides and — in this case — late-night snacks. — TOM PEDULLA — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN For those who came very early and by car, van or bus to MetLife Stadium, it was a pretty smooth commute. “We were expecting it to take an hour, but it only took 20 minutes,” said Gene Wickes, 61, of Vail, Colo, who joined a group van with his son, Freddy Wickes, 24, from Midtown Manhattan to get to New Jersey.  The Wickeses were among the early arrivals to the stadium, getting here just before 2 p.m. when the gates opened. They were hoping to take part in some of the pregame festivities.  It was a similarly easy trip for Tom and Lori Williams, who piled into an S.U.V. with three of their sons, all Seahawks fans from Whippany, N.J. “It was very straightforward,” Tom Williams said, adding that it took about 30 minutes. Mark Lyons and Bryan Maxwell, who were driving buses chartered by Stub Hub, were among the first to pull in near Stadium Entry Pavilion 2. “It was really smooth, believe it or not,” said Lyons, 48. “I’m impressed it went as smoothly as it did. It feels secure. It feels efficient.” The drivers now must wait for the game to end — and their fingers are crossed that the “second half” of their work day will be as easy as the first. — STEVE EDER Super Bowl XLVIII has been as much about water as it was expected to be about snow. The Broncos’ media availability all week was held aboard the Cornucopia Majesty, the largest luxury party ship in the Northeast at 30,000 square feet. The ship, which was docked outside the Jersey City Hyatt, where the team was staying, has five dining rooms and can accommodate up to 1,200 guests. Peyton Manning was not a big fan. “I wasn’t prepared for this rocking cruise ship,” Manning said when asked if there had been any holes in his preparation for the game. “There’s always a wrinkle to keep you on your toes.”   Another player, safety David Bruton, was asked what he thought of the ship on the first night of availability after the team’s arrival. “I hear it’s very nice,” he said in a nod to the whirlwind that is Super Bowl week. In addition to the players’ boat, there was the Bud Light Hotel, a lodging and entertainment site aboard Norwegian Cruise Line’s newest ship. The Getaway, which holds 4,028 passengers, was docked next to the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum on the West Side of Manhattan. There was even a small cruise ship docked next to the Taste of the N.F.L.’s Party With a Purpose on Saturday at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal for revelers seeking a change of scenery. The Broncos, who as the week wore on seemed to get their sea legs, will now do their best to find their balance on the field at MetLife Stadium. — MELISSA HOPPERT Early Sunday afternoon, fans attempted to navigate Pennsylvania Station in New York, approaching New Jersey Transit workers holding “Ask Me” signs. Where, one traveler asked, could riders find the connecting trains to MetLife Stadium once they arrived in Secaucus? “Follow everybody else,” an employee said. Though winding lines formed beside ticket windows as early as 1 p.m., many fans said that the first leg of their trip — getting to Secaucus — had gone relatively smoothly, despite the swelling crowds. Still, visitors appeared to greet Penn Station itself, long derided by locals, with ambivalence. “It’s functional,” said Toby Anderson, 45, a Broncos fan from Sacramento. “As far as the cleanliness, you know, what are you going to do?” Along platforms and near ticket machines, a series of chants and taunts filled the space: “Go Hawks!,” “Omaha!” and, in one clear reach, “Peyton Manning is mediocre at best.” Other atypical occurrences for the station included fans happily snapping photographs at ticket windows and at least one Seahawks supporter massaging the shoulder of a New Jersey Transit employee. Then there were the regular commuters, caught in the undertow of Russell Wilson jerseys. “I have no involvement with the Super Bowl,” Ashley Glaser, 19, a student from Park Ridge, N.J., said to a ticket agent. “I just want to get home.” Glaser said in an interview moments later that the scene on St.Patrick’s Day had probably been worse. But she cautioned that it was early. “No one is too drunk yet,” she said. — MATT FLEGENHEIMER The main concerns with a New York Super Bowl were the potential for cold weather and the problems with transporting so many people through the New York metropolitan area. Having left Manhattan in the first wave of media buses, I was able to get here and through security without any issues. Now seated in the auxiliary press box, the massive heating system installed to deal with the weather is so strong that no jacket is needed. So if the hiccups are transportation and weather, the N.F.L. is 2 for 2 so far. The lack of vegetarian meal options will have to be investigated, but otherwise we’re all systems go. There are not enough fans in the stands to get an idea of whether this crowd will be rooting for Denver or Seattle, but one thing is clear: Against the gray seats of MetLife Stadium, the orange Broncos jerseys show up quite a bit better than the blue and gray Seahawks jerseys, so it may end up looking like a Broncos home game. — BENJAMIN HOFFMAN Media Bus No. 1 was scheduled to leave Times Square for MetLife Stadium at 1:15 p.m. It was full by 12:15 — a 56-passenger commuter bus packed with reporters and photographers. Then came the security check. Two police officers and a dog boarded about 12:35 and walked though the bus. The dog looked happy to be working the aisle. “I trust dogs more than i trust humans when it comes to that stuff,” a radio reporter said. “A dog’s never going to get lazy.” Apparently the dog didn’t find anything amiss, and having completed their rounds, the dog and the officers left.  “You’re in lockdown,” one of the officers said as he went down the steps past the driver. “Just kidding.” But the driver closed the door and no one has gotten on or off since. Departure time remained 1:15. — JAMES BARRON I got a chance to take in the atmosphere of Super Bowl week from a couple of locations.  — BOB ECKSTEIN There is an old Scandinavian saying that roughly translates to, “There is no bad weather, only bad clothing.” Early last week, it looked as if 80,000 fans in MetLife Stadium would be testing that theory in real time when the Seahawks played the Broncos in Super Bowl XLVIII. But having bet on the league’s ability to handle its first cold-weather Super Bowl, the N.F.L. has seemingly caught a break. The temperature at kickoff is expected to be as high as the mid-40s, falling short of the coldest in Super Bowl history, a distinction held by Super Bowl VI in New Orleans. It was 39 degrees at Tulane Stadium when Mike Clark of the Dallas Cowboys kicked off to Mercury Morris of the Miami Dolphins and 81,023 people watched the Cowboys win, 24-3. With Sunday’s weather largely taken out of the equation, the fans in the stadium and at home will be free to focus on the matchup of the most productive offense in N.F.L. history and a young defense that already appears to be one of the best ever assembled. As with all Super Bowls, there have been plenty of subplots to keep people talking. The players were hounded all week, and the consensus from the news media was that Richard Sherman talked too much, Marshawn Lynch talked not enough, and Peyton Manning was just right. Along the way, there was enough discussion of Macklemore and legalized marijuana to make you occasionally forget that a football game was going to be played. But when the ball kicks off sometime after 6:25 p.m. Eastern, the N.F.L. will have its two best teams playing in the nation’s biggest market, which, before it even starts, has to be considered a huge success. — BEN HOFFMAN Advertisement
