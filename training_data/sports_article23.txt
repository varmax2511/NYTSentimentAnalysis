Advertisement By ANNE MANCUSO and PHILIP RICHARDSONJAN. 30, 2014  Lunar New Year Celebrations (Friday and Sunday) This weekend, not all the talk about the Year of the Horse will be referring to the Denver Broncos’ showdown with the Seattle Seahawks. For Friday is the first day of the Lunar New Year — this year in celebration of the horse — and events are scheduled all weekend in Lower Manhattan. On Friday, a gathering from 11 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. will include music and dancing, and at noon, there will be a ceremony with firecrackers in Sara D. Roosevelt Park, Chrystie Street, between Delancey and Broome Streets, Lower East Side. On Sunday, lion and dragon dancers, marching bands and other revelers will make their way through Chinatown and neighboring areas, in a parade — the 15th — that begins at 1 p.m. at Canal and Mott Streets; it ends at Grand Street. (Details: betterchinatown.com.) Other events include tours and family activities; information about these can be found on this page. For those who like to plan ahead, the ram is king next year.
