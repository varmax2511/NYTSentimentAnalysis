 The Chevrolet division of General Motors, one of many car brands that will be advertised during Super Bowl XLVI on Feb. 5, is seeking to stand out by offering an app that viewers can use during the game to play games, interact with one another through Twitter and win prizes.                 The free Chevy Game Time app, as it is called, was announced Thursday and will be available on Sunday at chevy.com/gametime and at the Apple App Store and Android Market.                 Chevrolet will run three or four commercials during the game, including one that won a contest among consumers to create a Chevy spot that would appear during the Super Bowl. The winner is a 26-year-old aspiring filmmaker from Merrick, N.Y., Zachary Borst, who created a humorous commercial for the Chevy Camaro.                 The app will be promoted in a commercial during Sunday’s N.F.L. playoff games in which Tim Allen, the announcer in Chevy spots, says, “Play along with the Super Bowl as we put in the game in your hands.”    The prizes Mr. Allen describes include 20 Chevrolets and thousands from marketer partners, among them Bridgestone, another Super Bowl advertiser; Papa John’s pizza; Motorola; and the National Football League.              Chevrolet is one of two General Motors brands that will be sponsoring Super Bowl XLVI, along with Cadillac. The other auto advertisers include Acura, Audi, Chrysler, Honda, Kia, Hyundai, Lexus, Toyota and Volkswagen.                 The goal of the app is to help viewers “find our commercials earlier” and garner them attention both during and after the game, said Joel Ewanick, global chief marketing officer at G.M. in Detroit.                 The games on the app will include trivia questions or polls about the Super Bowl as it is played, along with the commercials from G.M. and other advertisers.                  “The more we can bring attention to the commercials — everyone’s, not just ours — the better,” Mr. Ewanick said. “The app came out of that strategy of getting viewers engaged early.”                   Chevrolet is still deciding the models that will appear in its other spots in the Super Bowl, he added; contenders include Silverado, Sonic and Volt. The new Cadillac ATS will be promoted in the Cadillac commercial.                   Mr. Borst’s Camaro spot was selected from 198 video clips entered into what was called the Chevrolet Route 66 Contest, in connection with the brand’s 100th anniversary last year. Mr. Borst runs a production company named GoatFarm Films.                     The app needed the approval of the N.F.L., Mr. Ewanick said, because “this is the first time this has been done.”                      Chevrolet will also sponsor the live stream of the Super Bowl on nbcsports.com and is teaming up with Twitter and the N.F.L. for a promotion called Road to the #SuperBowl.
