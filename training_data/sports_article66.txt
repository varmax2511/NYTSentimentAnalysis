At Ellis Island on Tuesday morning, the crowd eagerly awaited Joe Namath. He was a guest of honor at an annual awards ceremony at which his family was being honored for the nobility of its immigrant experience.       But across the Hudson, at Battery Park, the football legend with the million-dollar smile was just another guy in the queue waiting for the Ellis Island ferry. It was his opportunity to get a small taste of what his Hungarian forbears had experienced when they set foot here nearly a century ago: long lines, hard benches and a gaggle of uniformed officers trying to keep things moving.      Approaching the metal detector, the Jet once known as Broadway Joe had to empty his pockets: wallet, coins, the Sharpie he uses to accommodate autograph seekers. Then he removed his Super Bowl ring from 1969, the upset win against the Colts that he famously guaranteed. He laid it in the bin. A security officer handed it back, but did make him take off his belt.     Mr. Namath reminisced while waiting for the boat about his first impression of New York: a trip with some University of Alabama chums to the World’s Fair in 1964. To this day, it amazes him that his car was waiting where he had haphazardly left it in Manhattan.  “That wouldn’t happen today,’’ he said.      No ticket, either. “Maybe they didn’t want to bother with out-of-state plates,’’ he mused.     Wearing a gold apple in his lapel and accompanied by his daughters, Jessica and Olivia, he wondered aloud how his grandfather Andras Nemet and his father, Janos, neither of whom spoke English on arrival, had the fortitude for the long journey from the Carpathian Mountains to the Pennsylvania steel town where he was raised. Neither made much fuss about what they had endured and just worked hard to assimilate, according to Mr. Namath.       His paternal grandfather, later known as Andy Namath, arrived in 1911 aboard the R.M.S. Pannonia. But Janos was left behind with his grandparents and did not rejoin the family until his mother went back for him in 1920. By that time, the boy was 11. “To this day, it just gives more credence to my belief that he came through big-time,’’ Mr. Namath said of his father.        On the ferry, he ran into Candice Bergen, the actress who had been asked by the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation to formally announce him and the other winners of Family Heritage awards, a rarefied circle that included Jerry Seinfeld, the comedian, and Dr. Eric R. Kandel, the Nobel Laureate. She also gave Gloria and Emilio Estefan, Cuban-born entertainers, a separate award that goes each year to newer arrivals.    “I hope I don’t get seasick,’’ Mr. Namath confided to Ms. Bergen. “This is not my kind of boat, really.’’     “He’s half-joking,’’ explained his elder daughter, Jessica. She noted that her father owns a 24-foot fishing boat named XII in homage to his longtime jersey number. She said he caught his first swordfish this Jan. 12 — the 40th anniversary of that Superbowl win.     He had spent the day catching Spanish mackerel, went home for a nap and then went back out at midnight to try his hand at swordfish. To get swordfish,  “you have to go at night,’’ she explained. “It’s a whole ‘nother thing.’’  Comments are no longer being accepted. Broadway Joe, We still need HEROES. Thank you for being YOU! EnEM as a native Alabamian, not sure why he picked U of A to go to college but i suspect it had a lot to do with the legendary coach Bear Bryant, when he said “will you play for me?,” you did and i’m glad he did, as he did a lot for our state. Glad someone did a nice thing for him, “Broadway Joe.” Bear Bryant referred to Joe Willie Namath as the greatest athlete he ever coached.  Now, really, what more needs to be said?   I literally grew up idolizing Joe Willie – he hit Bama when I was 11, and my Dad and I would eat the Golden Flake Potato Chips and Coca Cola that were the show’s sponsors while we watched the Bear Briyant show every Sunday afternoon during football season and listen to the Bear growl about how great Namath was.  The guaranteed victory over the Colts my senior year of high school just topped off what I thought was the career of the man I thought had just unseated Johnny Unitas as the greatest QB in the NFL.  And you can’t imagine what a trip that had to be until you visit Beaver Falls. namath will always be a hero in this town.by the way,in hindsight,that super bowl winning jets team had agreat roster and deserved to win super bowl 3 A great story about Joe’s family. Living in Alabama and a Crimson Tide supporter I have followed Joe’s career for many years. It was great to learn this about his family. Take care Joe! One of the greatest things about “Broadway Joe” is that he is still an everyman…despite his nickname’s connotation.  I had the pleasure of meeting Joe a couple of years ago.  Being a life-long supporter of the Crimson Tide, I was beside myself with pride and emotion.  Yet Joe took a few minutes to talk to me, he signed a football I had with me, and shook my hand and wished me well. Few of the “greats” in the NFL would repeat such a performance to a mere fan.  (Peyton Manning excluded, he was a terrific guy when I met him too.)  I hope Joe will also be recognized as an ambassador for the sport and an elder statesman; not simply for his brilliance on the field but for his character off of the field. Joe was one of my heroes growing up, bookended by Mickey Mantle and Walt Frazier. He is the reason I have been a diehard Jets fan for 43 years and counting, despite now having lived — like Tequesta, FL resident Joe himself — in Dolphins territory for a number of those years.
