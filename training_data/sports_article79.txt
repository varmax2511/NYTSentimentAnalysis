Amid the flow of Super Tuesdays, Superbowl surprises, news about faltering energy projects and rising solar cities, I’ve been collecting threads that relate to a central theme of Dot Earth: the implications of humanity’s growing numbers and resource thirst. Here are a few from the last few days: -A radio commentary quoting one of the less-familiar dictums of Adam Smith, who is best known for championing economic growth, but in this case was warning about too much of a good thing. -The hypnotically unnerving documentary “Manufactured Landscapes,” which glaringly displays the increasingly human-shaped face of Earth. -A sociology paper proposing that the best way to lessen consumption for its own sake is to reduce how much people work. (Is there a win-win here, or am I missing something?) -A paper in the journal Science on sustainability showing that, by one measure, afflictions related to affluence take away as many years of life as do ills associated with poverty. These papers and observations all circle around the two questions at the heart of the sustainability puzzle that will largely determine the quality of human lives and the environment in which they are lived: How many? How much?  How many people will inhabit Earth in the next few generations?  How much stuff – energy, land, water, marine life – will they consume? A few examples: The overlay of rising demand and lagging supply of oil or comparable liquid fuel will shape everything from economics to international conflict. The amount of coal extracted and burned (along with the oil) will influence climate for centuries to come. The extent of land used to grow fuel, food, or fiber will determine the costs of those necessities and also the fate of the world’s last untrammeled ecosystems. Back to the related nuggets above. I was listening to the public-radio program Marketplace and heard a guest commentary by Charles Handy, an expert on business management who founded the London Business School and is in residence at the Drucker School of Business of Claremont (Calif.) Graduate University. He was musing on the ideas of two departed pillars of economics, Adam Smith and Peter Drucker, in relation to limits to growth. An excerpt:   …I wonder how [Peter Drucker] would have reacted to some of the things that bother me. For instance, how would he respond to what I call “Adam Smith’s Great Conundrum?” Adam Smith, the father of economics, 250 years ago, said: “An investment is by all right-minded people to be commended, because it brings comforts and necessities to the citizenry. But, if continued indefinitely, it will lead to the endless pursuit of unnecessary things.” Now that I am living for a while in California, I am staggered by the amount of “unnecessary things” that I see in the malls that dot the suburbs. America is no different from anywhere else, of course — just more so. The conundrum is this: All that stuff creates jobs — making it, promoting it, selling it. It’s literally the stuff of growth. What I’d love to ask Peter Drucker is: How do you grow an economy without the jobs and taxes that these unnecessary things produce? Drucker saw business as the agent of progress. Its main responsibility, he said, was to come up with new ideas and take them to market. But not just any new ideas, please — only those that bring genuine benefits to the customers, and do not muck up the environment. The market, unfortunately, does not differentiate between good and bad. If the people want junk, the market will provide. So we have to fall back on the conscience of our business leaders.  Then there was “Manufactured Landscapes,” a film examining how human demands for resources and products are transforming the physical world, and the environment experienced on a daily basis by humans caught up in the rush of urbanized, mechanized, work-centered life. It does so over the shoulder of the Canadian photographer Edward Burtynsky, who has made chronicling the face of the Anthropocene epoch his life’s work of late. I saw a snippet of it when writing a post on the “urban age” last week, but finally had a chance to watch the DVD. It is an unforgettable experience, something like a mash-up of  “Apocalypse Now” and “Modern Times.” It is a sobering view, particularly the scenes in sprawling Chinese factory cities churning out the (unnecessary?) things that prosperous people seem to need in ever-rising amounts. Watch the hands of a young woman as she speeds through the 20 or so manipulations necessary to make an electronic device whose purpose she only can guess at. She makes 400 a day. Then watch as the camera pans cavernous halls full of similar workers, then cuts outdoors to the cordons of thousands of workers heading to yellow dormitories.  How many factories? How much stuff? Then came “Sustainable Consumption and Worktime Reduction,” a paper by Juliet Schor, a sociologist at Boston College, that I stumbled on while surfing a 2005 special issue of the journal Industrial Ecology on the global impacts of cities. The entire issue is enlightening.  She chronicles how industrialized economies have generally translated productivity gains in the workplace into making more stuff (and money to buy stuff) instead of making less work (reducing work hours).  A world heading toward 9 billion, however, following that path of ever more work and money to buy ever more stuff, cannot be sustained, Professor Schor concludes:  Achieving a sustainable and equitable global solution is clearly incompatible with a worldwide replication of U.S. lifestyles or even the somewhat less damaging ecological impacts of the lifestyles of other industrialized countries. In such a situation, inhabitants of the global North can and should opt for a new economic and social vision based on quality of life, rather than quantity of stuff, with reduced work time and ecological sustainability at its core. Such a vision has the potential to create broad-based pressure for an alternative to the current system of ecologically destructive, inequitable consumer-driven growth. Indeed, the future of the planet increasingly depends on it. This paper echoed ideas I explored in 2005, when writing on Bhutan’s experiment with “gross national happiness” as a substitute for the more familiar gross national product.  Finally, there was “Science and Technology for Sustainable Well-Being,” a paper in Science by John P. Holdren, the Harvard expert on energy, environment, development and lots of other things.  The paper is a sprawling portrait of a world poised between a livable path toward 9 billion and one wracked by disruption and suffering, along with a menu for limiting losses as we head into crunch time these next few decades. But one chart really grabbed my attention. By Dr. Holdren’s analysis, when you measure human tolls in years of life lost (e.g., a child cut down by disease loses decades; a grandmother dying of a stroke at 80 loses a few years.), the major afflictions of poverty and affluence do us in at roughly equal rates.  Childhood and maternal malnutrition, he estimates, erased 200 million life years in the year 2000. High blood pressure, cholesterol, obesity, and lack of physical activity erased 150 million life years. (There’s a long list of other causes, from war to tobacco.) So at each end of the development ladder – from not enough to too much – we get into trouble.  So are we now locked into the “endless pursuit of unnecessary things?” In thinking about this warning from Adam Smith, I can’t help but feel bad for Thomas Malthus, who has taken all the heat from free-market champions of eternal growth over the years.  Maybe it was Adam Smith who was the first Malthusian prophet of doom. Comments are no longer being accepted. What about all these e-mails you yourself are collecting? One does expect a founder of the social science of economics to appreciate the ultimate implications of the law of dimunition at the margin. I’m not sure the goal of reducing the amount of output is as desirable (even with the prospect of less work!) as it sounds.  Perhaps the better approach is instead of slowing people down we attempt to influence the perception of what success means. If you understand what is learned in the book, “The Millionaire Next Door”, you’ll see that successful (and often happier) people produce a lot more than they consume.  On the contrary, people who suffer in this economy tend to be at the other end, consuming more than they produce.  Often they do this in some attempt to “keep up” with their peers, while what seems to be happening is an arms race of consumption by folks completely unprepared to pay the cost of the race. Perhaps re-applying stigma to financial failure, something that the bankruptcy-mill law firms have been working to remove (“It’s not your fault!  Call us and we’ll GET YOU OUT OF DEBT!”) would be valuable, especially if taught in school. Nobody is entitled to an iPod or a Wii or a 50 inch plasma TV or bling or even a car until they’ve achieved the wherewithall to actually pay for it.  And generally, once you’ve actually accumulated the money necessary to afford such things, you start to value other things more than the ostentatious display. Here’s the new message.  It is your fault.  If you can’t afford it, put it back.  If you don’t make enough, either work harder or get more training/education.  Carrying revolving debt consisting of past burrito purchases is dumb. It really is easier to spend debt than to spend savings.  Perhaps a refocusing on financial education would help solve this problem of excessive consumption. And you’d be surprised, when people are relieved of the psychological load of excessive consumer debt and the demand to keep up, they will (IMHO) look more carefully at resource consumption on a larger scale.  Because they’ll notice their friends who have a designer purse full of maxed out credit cards and be repulsed by the idea. When the government can no longer tax us to pay for the drugs to treat hypertension, obesity, diabetes and atherosclerosis, it will tell us to ‘Work for Food’, and the problem will resolve itself. =================== Jeez, Andy, get with the program: “The American way of life is non-negotiable.” That’s George Bush I’s comment on the Rio Earth Summit. An attitude that probably began with Herbert Hoover’s campaign promise of “a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage.” Our political culture cannot handle talk of the “endless pursuit of unnecessary things,” unfortunately. Doesn’t poll well. There are exceptions — like the late Senator Gaylord Nelson who said (borrowing from Herman Daley?) “the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment.” Thank you Andrew for asking these questions. I have been posing this scenario to any who will listen: We can also reduce our CO2 emmissions by reducing consumption. For instance, junk mail. Certainly few would oppose putting a stop to junk mail. Post office will need fewer employees, mail trucks will drive fewer miles, the mail trucks will need new tires less often and less maintenance….a few mechanics will lose their jobs, a lumber jack and trucker lose their jobs, somewhere a paper mill will close and a printing press will go quite. You might imagine all the other workers and families that are affected. We have burned less fossil fuel, reduced our carbon emmissions, cut fewer forests and no more junk mail, all good things. But thousands of people lose their jobs. I look forward to “hearing” what your readers have to say on this subject. Chris  Imagine all the things we can How much longer can the Earth be reasonably and sensibly expected to sustain the colossal, unbridled growth of human consumption, production and propagation activities now overspreading the surface of our planetary home?  The current scale and unlimited growth of human population numbers worldwide as well as of the seemingly endless production and unrestrained human consumption of unnecessary things on a planet with the relatively small size and makeup of Earth inevitably becomes unsustainable at some point in space-time, does it not? Whatsoever is is, is it not? Thomas Malthus was not considering the side-effect of excessive food in the environment leading to obesity. Powerful and advanced machinery combined to food industry technology can produce food in all shapes, tastes, colors, and preferences to hunt man at any niche of his existence. Fresh fruits contain around 70% water while biscuits contain just 10%. Fruits satiate faster and with more appropriate nutrition delivering less digestible nutrients and more balanced vitamins and minerals. Food in the chain is not only excessive but also highly processed and inappropriate to feed humans to a healthy lifestyle. Processed food also are more digestible for receiving mechanical, and thermal treatment, and additives to chance color, taste, texture, and flavor.  Human appetite was designed wildly to gulp on plenty times and store fat to cope common shortages that presently was razed from our modern environment. Nowadays it becomes even difficult to sociologists to address such complexity in modern life when nutrition and physiology play a strong factor within the food chain and agricultural systems. Malthus was not taking into account also that all sorts of machinery expanding the power of human muscle work to change deeply the environment would help to mold a new modern man sedentary and flaccid hurting the physiological functioning. It is predicted by the increasing obesity trend that by 2050 half of the population will be obese. Obesity brings general side-effects to human life like diabetes, apnea, organs failure, and less reproductive power.  I believe that modern man will not reach 9 billions before start crumbling to its own failure to achieve a healthy and sustainable lifestyle. The truth is that we are hurting ourselves in the same way that we are spoiling the environment. The solution for a balanced lifestyle is easy to discuss and confirm, but very hard to achieve on a broad scale of human affairs. Eating plenty of fruits and vegetables as well as keep a body fit with any sort of body activity. The world changed a lot recently on our power to know and understand. I am posting this opinion now. Everyday I can get fresh news around the world since I have a news alert at Google sending me links of anything in the internet that mention the word ‘obesity’. I know about obesity going on in New Zealand, Japan, Australia, England, Denmark, Africa, China, Hawaii, etc. Malthus was not aware on what the food industry could do to change human feeding habits. He did not see much about the power of food marketed in plastic packaging and TV ads. Slowly we are learning about the side-effects of excessive food, alcohol, drugs, smoking, and sedentarism. People doing body fitness are having a healthier life, more calcium in their bones, less stress on their routine, more neurons in their hippocampus for more memory and cognitive senses. Body fitness improves sexual performance and capacity to work harder or have more adventure in their lives for standing higher body demand.  People caring for their health drink less alcohol, avoid drugs or smoking keeping their body fit should be ready to cope other stress in the surviving struggle we are facing in the course of modern life. The system is very tricky with flaws to endorse the economic system. Milk is the product that nature designed to feed new born mammals not necessary after we are weaned. Milk is good for the economy and not necessarily for human health. So, we can understand the underlying reasoning behind government guidelines for nutrition and many other things – promote the economy. Indeed we are made to believe that we need something when in fact that requirement is more for an economic growth than a real benefit.  Actually we have to be very careful on our real need supporting the economy that is also profiting from our disgrace.  The economic system makes money selling excessive food, selling diet pills, selling baric surgeries. Money goes around and comes around fattening us, and making us shedding weight; selling machinery to replace our mechanical work and selling machine to make us get fit. A healthier lifestyle is a personal decision to adopt many shortcuts that slow down the economy profiting on our blatant collapse. Not everything is bad and not everything is good, but a wise decision to accept or adopt only those ones that can keep human lives in balance with the fundamentals of our existence is the keystone. Down the line we are understanding how much modern life is tricking and spoiling our fragile existence. What we really need is a new way of looking at life itself, or, rather, a new way of living it.  As Edward Abbey  pointed out two decades ago, “It should be clear to everyone by now that crude numerical growth does not solve our chronic problems of unemployment, welfare, crime, traffic, filth, noise, squalor, the pollution of our air, the corruption of our politics, the debasement of the school system (hardly worthy of the name ‘education’), and the general loss of popular control over the political process–where money, not people, is now the determining factor.”  Though this was written two decades ago, the elections of 2008 in the United States would have stunned Abbey with their gross extravagance.  He would not, however, have been surprised at all by Vice-President Al Gore’s comment that “Over and over again, wealth and power have become concentrated in the hands of a few who consolidate and perpetuate their control at the expense of the many.”   John Saul put a finger on one major problem when he noted that “The central perception of Globalization [which affects us all today] is that civilization should be seen through economics, and economics alone.”   There are cheerleaders for globalization.  For example, Thomas Friedman wrote that “. . . what the flattening of the world [his view of technology and globalization] means is that we are now connecting all the knowledge centers on the planet together into a single global network, which–if politics and terrorism don’t get in the way–could usher in an amazing era of prosperity and innovation.”  Though billions of people live outside those “knowledge centers” Friedman even cites Bill Gates’s comment that “Natural talent has started to trump geography.”  I’m not so sure about that, though I do agree with Brett Wallach that so far globalization probably has had more benefits than costs and that “We’re in this globalization to our eyeballs, and we’re in it together, regardless of our passports and bank books.”  I’m less convinced that Wallach is correct when he asserts that “. . . globalization goes far beyond products, companies, and jobs.  It goes to the way people think.  It creates a global civilization with a single shared, sustaining ideology.”  If that ideology is driven by a belief in sustained economic growth, then I do not agree.  Rather, I am closer to John Saul, who suggests that “It may be that we are now not only at the end of the Globalist period but also at the end of the Western rationalist period and its obsessions with clear linear structures on every subject.”   Defense of the rationalist period can be found among virtually all economists, but it has led us now to a paradox.  On the one hand our material wealth has grown beyond belief, but on the other hand we are increasingly aware of the vast damage that we have done to Earth’s ecosystems.  We are ambivalent about our success. Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner wrote that “Morality, it could be argued, represents the way that people would like the world to work–whereas economics represents how it actually does work.  Economics is above all a science of measurement.”  But not everything of value can be reduced to numbers and formulas, as Pascal was well aware.  For example, Adam Gopnik pointed out that “Numbers and honesty and transparency only get you so far in the world.  Our experiences of everything are too mediated–by contexts and intentions and likeness–to be summed up in a number.”   Just as our population cannot grow forever, our lives require more for satisfaction than endless shelves of cheap goods at Wal-Mart.  As Edward Abbey noted, “Growth for the sake of growth is the ideology of the cancer cell.”  The world as it is in 2008 is simply not sustainable, despite what economists argue.  “Sustainable growth” is an oxymoron, as we will almost assuredly find out during the current century.   Whether Abbey or Saul are right or not, it is clear that we live in a time when individual hedge fund managers on Wall Street are making over a billion dollars a year while most people in the poorest countries are surviving on less than one or two dollars a day.  As Immanuel Wallerstein  wrote, “We live in an imperfect world, one that will always be imperfect and therefore always harbor injustice.  But we are far from helpless before this reality.  We can make the world less unjust; we can make it more beautiful; we can increase our cognition of it.”  Finally, as Edward Abbey  put it, “A world entirely conquered by technology, entirely dominated by industrial processes, entirely occupied by man and machine, would be a world unfit to live in.” As Andy suggests with Adam Smith, and as I’ve suggested with other classical economists such as Malthus, David Ricardo, and John Stuart Mill, these folks had wide-ranging minds and saw the world in very different and more complex terms than do modern economists.  Today our world view is dominated by the calculus of neoclassical economics, and underlying that view is the notion that growth is always a desirable goal and that resources are infinite.  That defies both common sense and ecological reality. People are part of the problem, as are some of our uses of technology, globalization in its present state, and our endless assault on the environment.  The following quote is from John Stuart Mill’s Principles of Political Economy (1848), a time when the population of the world had just topped its first billion and there were about 23 million people living in the United States: “It is scarcely necessary to remark that a stationary condition of capital and population implies no stationary state of human improvement.  There would be as much scope as ever for all kinds of mental culture, and moral and social progress; as much room for improving the Art of Living, and much more likelihood of its being improved, when minds ceased to be engrossed by the art of getting on.  Even the industrial arts might be as earnestly and as successfully cultivated, with this sole difference, that instead of serving no purpose but the increase of wealth, industrial improvements would produce their legitimate effect, that of abridging labour. . . . Only when, in addition to just institutions, the increase of mankind shall be under the deliberate guidance of judicious foresight, can the conquests made from the powers of nature by the intellect and energy of scientific discoverers, become the common property of the species, and the means of improving and elevating the universal lot.” Let me end with a few final observations that scientists and others have made about population, quality of life, and the environment.  Mark Bush, an ecologist, noted that “The human population is, therefore, the root cause of most environmental problems, and the sheer number of humans plays a very significant role in degrading the environment.”  Writing about the Industrial Revolution, Joel Kotkin commented that “This new industrial society may have been creating unprecedented wealth, but at the cost of every basic human value.”  Bruce Babbitt echoed similar thoughts, stating that “Development should enlarge the possibilities for human progress, creativity, and quality of life, which it cannot accomplish by continually eroding the beauty and productivity of the natural world.”  According to Jared Diamond “Our world society is presently on a non-sustainable course. . . Thus, because we are rapidly advancing along this non-sustainable course, the world’s environmental problems will get resolved, in one way or another, within the lifetimes of the children and young adults alive today.”  Whether that resolution is pleasant or not will depend on choices that we are making today, and must be making in the years ahead.  Jack Weatherford went so far as to suggest that “Whether we take an optimistic view or a pessimistic one, it seems clear that we stand now at the conclusion of a great age of human history.  This ten-thousand-year episode seems to be coming to an end, winding down.”  Lester Brown  wrote that “If we cannot stabilize population and if we cannot stabilize climate, there is not an ecosystem on earth we can save.”  Richard Heinberg  warned us that “Overpopulation is currently one of humanity’s greatest problems, and it will become a far greater one with the gradual disappearance of fossil energy resources.”  Pimentel and Wilson  pointed out that “As the world population continues to expand, all vital natural resources will have to be divided among increasing numbers of people and per-capita availability will decline to low levels.  When this occurs, we believe that it will become quite difficult to maintain prosperity, a quality life, and even personal freedoms for those who already enjoy them, much less secure those benefits for the billions currently living without.” [Boldface added by Andy Revkin.] My Unnecessary Things could use a little of this from Maria: From the Sound of Music: Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens Brown paper packages tied up with strings These are a few of my favorite things Cream colored ponies and crisp apple streudels Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings These are a few of my favorite things Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes Silver white winters that melt into springs These are a few of my favorite things When the dog bites When the bee stings When I’m feeling sad I simply remember my favorite things And then I don’t feel so bad thanks to //www.stlyrics.com/lyrics/thesoundofmusic/myfavoritethings.htm Adam Smith also had some choice things to say about what we now call perverse economic subsidies and the ecological harm they cause. (And so beat out my colleague Norman Myers by over two centuries.) “Adam Smith considered the subsidies to the Scottish herring industry in his 1776 book The Wealth of Nations.  He called them “bounties.” Herrings were an important part of the food of the common people.  Subsidized herrings might, he hypothesized, “contribute to the relief of a great number of our fellow-subjects, whose circumstances are by no means affluent.”  He rejected this hypothesis by concluding that “the legislature has been very grossly imposed upon” in paying bounties. Bounties had the effect of encouraging “rash undertakers to adventure in a business they do not understand,” knowing that the government would bail them out if they failed. ” (World According to Pimm, a Scientist Audits the Earth) So, yep, a man far greener than his present image. Cheers, Stuart Doris Duke Professor of Conservation Ecology Nicholas School of Environment and Earth Sciences Duke University Durham, NC 27708, USA //www.nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/pimm/ Very uneasy questions.  With uneasy answers.  In both senses of “uneasy”. While it’s dogma that we all would benefit from having to work less- this is not demonstrated.  Ask someone who’s retired, in the USA; or on welfare.  While we’d love to think people with extra time would spend it on poetry and erudite study of the cosmos- in fact they are much much more likely to spend it on beer, drugs, and pornography. And I’m going to suggest there’s another limit to growth – Peak Gullibility. //littlebloginthebigwoods.blogspot.com/2008/02/peak-patsies-is-here.html Is consumption declining?  There are signs. What a great post.  Thanks for the Adam Smith quote. I think the proper goal is summed up in Professor Schor’s remark, “…[we] should opt for a new economic and social vision based on quality of life, rather than quantity of stuff, with reduced work time and ecological sustainability at its core.”  It’s likely few people appreciate the value of promoting and protecting a less that 40-hour work week. Trinifar Yes, the major issue of our times, particularly for Americans, how do you remove society from production as work and consumption as reward hamster wheel when it is the dominant culture paradigm. It has created its own church and priesthood that defines and thus controls reality to as great as an extent as the Church did in Medieval Europe. Just look at how Al Gore, Silicon Valley, and some of the top enviro groups are defining the “solutions” to global warming as a “major economic opportunity.” Finally, as the American economy enters a recession, we will watch a very narrow debate between Keynesian demand or supply-side stimulus, two sides of the same coin. peace joe Andrew and commenters, Welcome to the party. Now this conversation is getting serious and to the point. Those interested in this topic might want to take a look at John Feeney’s site: Growth is Madness, at: //growthmadness.org/ He’s been engaged in a responsible discussion of this topic for quite a while. We are, indeed, on the threshold of comprehending that the classical view of economics is dead wrong in many regards. Evolutionary and ecological economics show the human-built world to be every bit as much a part of the ecos as any ‘wild’ landscape. The only difference is that man has a penchant for turning raw materials and energy into non-contributing stuff. It’s a one-way process, whereas the rest of nature works on material cycles and natural (read solar, tidal, and geothermal) energy flows. We cheated by dipping into the bank of fossil energy stores with abandon. Poor judgments about what is important in life, at what rate should we proceed to develop, what is our natural balance with the rest of nature, and so forth have dominated our history. I have been concerned about this abandon for years. My own interest is in the phenomenon of wisdom, or rather the lack thereof, in human decision-making. As a species we seem to not really have a long-term, wide-angle, reality-based, and love-motivated view of the world (a terse definition of wisdom). Yet today’s complex, interrelated world requires global-scale wisdom and judgment. I fail to see this in any of the crop of leaders and wannabe leaders today unfortunately. But I am encouraged to see these kinds of conversations emerging from the crowd.  The coupled issues of over-consumption and population are critical factors in all of the global issues we have been discussing. They are proximal causes of the degradation of the world. But they are also, themselves, caused by the evolutionarily determined behavioral psychology of Homo sapiens. People do these things and are married to these ideas because there is a deep wiring of the brain that once benefited humans but now seems to lead to non-sustainable and selective disadvantaged behavior en masse.  There is, however, a way out. We are not slaves to ancient genetic endowment. The prefrontal cortex provides humans with a capacity to override behaviors and tendencies based on a grander understanding of the situation. The problem we face, as a species, is that the prefrontal development is relatively stunted compared with our needs in a globalized, complex world. Wisdom comes from an ability to think far ahead in time with comprehensive models of how the world works. The latter comes from the capacity (natural) to think and learn systemically. It derives from a motivation to love and integrate with all of nature. Humans, on average, have some capacity for this kind of mentation. But it was just emerging in the late Pleistocene when the development of intelligence and creativity seems to have overtaken the growth of wisdom and led to our drive for invention and domination over the natural world (agriculture and artifacts). If and when future human evolution produces greater prefrontal capacity we will see a shift in human behavior away from self-, family-, and tribal-centered and selfish, near-term judgment to much more inclusive, caring and sharing behavior. Our judgments will be more comprehensive and oriented toward a more universal good. The development toward that end is already visible in the past evolution of our species. There is a trajectory found in the development of altruistic and cooperative social behaviors over the course of hominid evolution. Follow the trajectory. And note that there are a few examples of this kind of mind among us today. Unfortunately, that evolution may proceed through another bottleneck. It may be that a significant collapse of the current population will restrict the survival of the qualities of prefrontal capacity needed for wisdom. Given our current course of actions (and failures to understand and act in timely fashion) one could easily project such a scenario. However, I would like to believe that if conversations such as this can find some purchase in our current less-than-optimal state of wisdom, we will use our significant cleverness (combined intelligence and creativity) to find humane ways to ease the population down to some sustainable level while evolution does its thing. I realize this is a giant leap for most reading this. I have a tendency to think way outside the box. Definitely, I question the conventional wisdom! George //www.questioneverything.typepad.com/ PS. At my academic website you can find a bibliography of evolutionary behavioral research and wisdom research. //faculty.washington.edu/gmobus/research.html Consider what happens to deer on an island with no natural predators to keep their population in check… I was going to write a long response to this, but really, my sentiments have been echoed by many other posters and I won’t take up more space. I just urge EVERYONE to take a look at this video: //www.thestoryofstuff.com It’s a really amazing 20 minute walk-through of how we got to be the consumer society we are, a look at the actual processes of production, distribution, consumption, and disposal, and thoughts on how we can change. Thanks as always for the stimulating posts, Mr. Revkin. Yes, in agreement with above, a great post. One of the consequences of the Milton Friedman dream of stripping the government out of the free market is that one ends up being governed by consumers, rather than citizens. Bravo, Andy. Thank you for this article. I’d like to quote, Roderick Frazier Nash, Professor Emeritus of History and Environmental Studies at UC California, Santa Barbara. This is a perfect place to insert an excerpt of an essay he wrote in 1996 in Plateau Journal. I picked it up after I’d hiked out of the Grand Canyon’s Phantom Ranch, where I was humbled in a way I never knew possible. Talk about a miniscule nothing? Looking at the geological history in a place like that canyon should shake everyone into acting on behalf of saving what’s left of this wild planet. Though how, as you so eloquently chronicle above in terms of economics, remains the bigger question. I think my life is bad sometimes. Jesus, those people in that assembly line photo above…..God help them. “as a result of our sheer numbers (5.8 billion and counting at the rate of 10,000 new human lives each hour), our unprecedented technological power, and our lack of an ethic that embraces the environment, we are no longer thinking or acting like a part of nature. Or, if we are a part, it is a cancerous one, growing so rapidly as to endanger the larger whole. Our species, in a word, is a terrible neighbor to the 30 million or so other species that share this planet. Right now we desperately need a “time out” to learn how to be team players; we need to learn how to live responsibly in the larger community called the ecosystem. What wilderness provides is precisely this “time out”. Its presence reminds us of just how far we have separated from the rest of nature. In wild places we stand naked of the civilized habitat our technology has created, open to seeing ourselves once again as large mammals totally dependent on the health of our environment. We learn gratitude, humility, and dependency. We are reminded of the old ways that nourished us both ecologically and psychologically for so long. Thoreau was more correct than he knew about the critical importance of wildness and wilderness to the preservation of the world. The human being is inextricably linked to the health, diversity and normal functioning of the global ecosystem”.  I hope Julia Butterfly proves right: no matter how far down the wrong road we go, we can always turn around and go back to the right road. That right road being to just “stop” for God’s sake, and regroup toward less of everything. Elizabeth Tjader It’d be nice if all these gadgets were repairable. Now, they are sealed shut, even with batteries, and we can’t get them fixed. We have to buy whole new units. Talk about wasteful. By asking about the sustainability of our collective future in terms of “how many people” and “how much will they consume”, I hear  Four Horsemen in Hair Shirts clattering toward us to save the planet!   But when they arrive, will Americans, Chinese and everyone else mend their “too many and too much” ways in the face of war, famine and disease?  Fear and want rarely bring out the best in us and dire conditions can turn anyone into an immigrant or a case of population excess.  Perhaps this Hair Shirt foursome will make us profligates mend our ways and emulate the environmentally virtuous, but don’t count on it. Today, sustainability and climate aren’t make the cut of top issues in the US Presidential race.  The fact is that by casting these critical issues as a matter of consumer choice and lifestyle is deeply apolitical and it means that they won’t make the cut.  But it’s not too late to find the public and collective aspects of a path toward sustainability, but we have to start by asking the right questions.  [ANDY REVKIN belatedly says: You stopped too soon. What are the right questions?] EM, Given the success of some efforts to recycle unused stuff (and prevent the creation of more) such as Craigslist, freecycle etc, perhaps it would make sense for some of the green-minded and technologically gifted among us to create gadget recycling services, where they’d accept items deemed unusable, harvest usable parts and recycle the rest. With some effort, they might even be able to identify common design and manufacturing flaws that lead generally cheap (too cheap to repair) items breaking down and becoming the refuse we aren’t able to deal with.  They could put that sort of information into the public sphere and 1)influence purchasing decisions, 2) shame designers and manufacturers into improving their output, 3) create a parts inventory for people who would like to fix an item rather than throw it away. They might even shame designers into making items repairable.  Many small gadgets have to be broken to get to the innerts.  If that weren’t the case, repair would be more common. Sustainability, Morality (in a broad sense), the Media, the Big Elephant, and Etc. As I have posted before on Dot Earth, perhaps ten times now, I believe that it can be shown (based on the latest science and on sound reasoning closely attached to that science) that: Morality itself (in the broad scientific-philosophical sense of the term) is most foundationally “about” the sustainable and healthy survival of the human species along with plentiful biological diversity along with the sustainable health of our home, planet Earth, all accomplished in a way that respects human equality (in important senses) and embraces a living and somewhat fragile planet. I post this here, again, because several people on this thread make very good points that preview, or point to, or underscore, certain key elements of this broader picture. The recent Google announcement also “points to” and illustrates this notion, just as one example.  The movie “Children of Men” illustrates, in part, the central theme.  And so forth.   Shifting subjects (although all of these subjects are interrelated, of course): There is, of course, a problem that needs to be acknowledged, faced, and addressed, which is this:  Although we humans do have an “issue” and (in some cases) habit of over-consumption, the media themselves get their lifeblood (in other words, revenues) in large part from advertisers, who provide those revenues because the ads help sell us more stuff, much of which we don’t need.  This fundamental point is still the Big Elephant on the table in the room, culturally speaking.  The media would rather discuss anything BUT this point.  They can’t, of course, explain precisely why this point should not be discussed or addressed, at least not rationally.  Instead, they just “assume it away” or hope that it goes away.  But it won’t, this time around, especially as problems (and considerations) of the (lack of) sustainability become increasingly more obvious and harmful, to more and more people.   In a sense, there seems to be a competition of sorts to see who can remain in greater denial for the longer period of time, on different (but both vastly important) issues:  The media, or the coal industry?  Of course, there are at least one or two other major segments of the economy in this competition as well.         The situation has already gone past the point of being Orwellian, in my view, when media outlets discuss over-consumption even as most of the paper is devoted to ad space. Earlier today, I visited the area on the Times’ website devoted to the candidates’ views on global warming.  I visited the area at least three times, perhaps four or five, while I was trying to read about the candidates’ specific views regarding coal.  Each time I visited, an online color ad appeared, on the climate change page of the Times’ site, and it was a Chevron ad. Although I don’t necessarily agree with him on every single matter (but I do on several key matters), if I remember correctly, Al Gore raises concerns about the relationship between media (and news) and money in his great book, “The Assault on Reason.”  Many other people have also pointed out the problem, of course.  But, the media seem to ignore the problem, and it just gets worse, and we seem to let it pass.   So, I’ll end with three great quotes:   “Anyone who wants a certain result, but is quite happy with the absence of what would bring it about, has obviously no understanding of either causes or effects.” – Petrarch “The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.” – Albert Einstein “Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored.” – Aldous Huxley I hope this post is helpful in some way.  Sorry to shout so loudly, but it seems that whispering on this issue does not get anywhere with the media. Re:  comment #15 Dear Mr. Mobus, In large part, our behavior is motivated by instinct. If we did not have the instinct to desire to have things, then how would we have survived as a species in the first place?   Advertising manipulates this instinct, causing us to believe that things will give us satisfaction and pleasure, even if they are completely unnecessary. Furthermore, in recent times, the culture of the U.S. has been transformed by television. It must be clear to one and all that human beings are nearly addicted to this form of visual stimulation.  Our mass culture is now very much driven by what we see on television. Television is all business. If we, as a people, are to turn in another direction that is away from consumption of the many needless goods offered to us, how shall we accomplish this? I think that the answer, for our culture at any rate, must lie with business and consumers working together. For all of us, there must be an increased awareness of the consequences of our consumption/production. We must be taught to waste not, want not, and to like it. Andrew, This following little adverbial phrase of yours: “glaringly displays the increasingly human-shaped face of Earth,” is a tiny window into your mind, an innocently written phrase that suddenly makes your otherwise hidden nihilism *glaringly* clear.   Maybe you should think about the role of inchoate *human-hatred* in all this discourse about climate change.   As far as I’m concerned, “climate change” is another way to speak about “original sin.”  Like the dogmatic religious thought it so bizarrely and unwittingly mimics, thought about climate change is a way of *hating human beings* for their complex and aggressive nature. Think hard about these points.  [ANDY REVKIN notes: I love many human-altered landscapes, and am a big fan, for example, of Rene Dubos, who championed the idea that humans can live harmoniously with their environment. The film focuses on the more stunning examples of extraction and industrialization done with little focus on harmony. The whole idea of this blog is to examine the choices that can be made to advance the human enterprise without diminishing Earth’s patrimony for those to come. It’s all about human landscapes.] By 2050 or so, the human population is expected to pass nine billion. Those billions will be seeking food, water and other resources on a planet where humans are already shaping climate and the web of life. Dot Earth was created by Andrew Revkin in October 2007 -- in part with support from a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship -- to explore ways to balance human needs and the planet's limits. The blog moved to the Opinion side of The Times in 2010 when Revkin left the Times staff to teach communication courses at Pace University. He won a National Academies Communication Award for Dot Earth in 2011 and Time Magazine named him one of the web's 25 top bloggers in 2013. In December 2016, Revkin ended the blog and left Pace to return to full-time journalism as senior reporter on climate and related issues for the public-interest newsroom ProPublica. Click here for a narrated slide show on the roots of Revkin's journalistic journey.
