(short for “training facility”). The unseasonably warm weather has caused a frenzy among skaters who wanted to get as many tricks in as possible before winter. Among them was Konstantin Satchek, the 27-year-old founder of Quartersnacks, a revered blog that chronicles the New York skate scene. Dressed in a gray hooded sweatshirt, dark trousers and Nike skate shoes, Mr. Satchek is an unassuming and shy figure, but he isn’t unknown. Newcomers to the park stop to greet him. “You run Quartersnacks, right?” said a skater in his late 20s, who wore a baseball cap and Supreme sweatshirt. “Yes, I’m Kosta,” said Mr. Satchek, who seemed surprised to be recognized. The two chatted briefly about skating and mutual friends, before rolling their separate ways.

Through hundreds of photos, essays and maps scribbled on napkins and envelopes, it serves as a field guide to a vibrant New York subculture, as well as the language, fashion and rituals that define it. Advertisement It is also a eulogy for a specific time and a place in New York’s recent past. “Those days are gone for me and for most of the city, in all honesty,” writes Isak Buan, an original member of the Quartersnacks crew, in one of the book’s essays. “New York has evolved into a newer, sleeker, glass-windowed creature. The streets are paved, bike lanes drawn, skate parks built — this is a childproof version of the city I knew.” Mr. Satchek started Quartersnacks in 2005, when he was a high school student in West New York, N.J., who would take the PATH train into Manhattan to skate. New York, he said, was still shaky from the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. “After 9/11, it was literally impossible to skate anywhere because of the security,” he said. With once-popular skating spots, including a park near 1 Police Plaza and various plazas in the financial district, now off limits, skaters turned to the T.F. “It was a weird couple years after 9/11 to be skating downtown,” Mr. Buan said. “There was security everywhere, cameras everywhere, people freaking out.” Mr. Satchek and friends started Quartersnacks as a way to connect with other skaters from New York, New Jersey and beyond. It reported on the scene at the T.F. and other spots, provided cutting criticism of the skate industry and offered tributes to skate history as well as occasional nods to non-skating-related happenings (mostly references to the New York Knicks, rap music and trendy nightclubs). With video-streaming sites like YouTube just starting, Quartersnacks also became an outlet for sharing short videos that function as calling cards for skaters to showcase their tricks, clothing and music tastes. But the emphasis was on the writing and storytelling. Mr. Satchek studied journalism at Fordham University, and worked briefly as an intern covering local news at The Jersey Journal. Some posts feature funny anecdotes. “Seven or eight years before Katy Perry was dancing alongside some sharks for Superbowl 49’s halftime show, she was at Beatrice, putting her number into Mike G’s flip phone,” read a photo caption in February. Others feature style. “The 30 Phattest Outfits in Skate Video History: 1992-2012,” read a post in September timed to New York Fashion Week.

A post in October paid tribute to Astor Place, a former hangout for skaters that has been transformed by luxury residential and office buildings.

Quartersnacks is rare in that it appeals to both the older generation of New York skaters — those who started in the 1980s — and those just discovering the city on a board. “I prefer the old, gritty, pre-Internet, no-camera-in-your-pocket era of the ’90s, when things weren’t necessarily documented,” said Jefferson Pang, 44, one of the first professional skateboarders to come out of New York. (He is currently a sales director for DC Shoes.) “You heard about things through word of mouth, like folklore.” For Mr. Pang, Quartersnacks is an “unpolished version of what’s being put out by the rest of skateboard media,” he said. “It’s more relatable.” Much has changed in 10 years. The T.F. is still the T.F., only now the skaters share it with softball and hockey leagues, and the corner bodegas and dollar-slice pizzerias are being replaced by banks and organic food stores. As the sun started to set in the East Village, Mr. Satchek said a round of goodbyes, making plans for later that night. One younger skater wanted to know when he would get his copy of the book. “I’ve got one for you,” Mr. Satchek assured him. “Skateboarding is just organized hanging out,” he said. The purpose of the website, he added, “is kind of cataloging the more interesting parts of the day. All those weird little characters — the one crazy kid that was around for two summers that would always make you laugh — are a huge part of it.” Continue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion, and Vows), and Instagram.
