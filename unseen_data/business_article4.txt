SoftBank will sell its 20-plus percent stake as part of the deal, Bloomberg said, adding Google's parent Alphabet Inc was likely to participate in the investment with Walmart. A final close of the deal is expected within 10 days, although deal terms could still change and a deal isn't certain, Bloomberg reported. Flipkart and Alphabet did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Walmart and SoftBank declined to comment. Earlier this week, Indian TV channel CNBC-TV18 reported that Amazon.com Inc has made a formal offer to buy 60 percent of Flipkart. Amazon, which is Flipkart's biggest rival in India, declined to comment on that report.  (Reporting by Sankalp Phartiyal; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
