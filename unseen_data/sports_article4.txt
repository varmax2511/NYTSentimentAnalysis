The NBA admitted Thursday night that officials in Game 5 didn't do the Sixers any favors by missing two calls against the Celtics late in the 114-112 series-clinching loss the previous night. In the league's Last Two Minutes Report, the NBA acknowledged referees missed an Aron Baynes foul on a potential game-tying layup by Joel Embiid with 14 seconds left. Baynes made "contact to Embiid's arm that affects his shot attempt near the rim" the report said. The report also admits that Celtics guard Marcus Smart traveled after recovering a desperation shot by Ben Simmons with 1.5 seconds left, though no infraction was called. No team in NBA history has overcome a 3-0 series deficit. The Celtics, with the victory, advanced to face LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference finals. --Field Level Media Advertisement    Collapse SEE MY OPTIONS
